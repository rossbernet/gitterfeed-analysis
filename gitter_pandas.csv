lossyrob,Hey everyone. Welcome to the GeoTrellis room!,3/31/15,1
non,hello!,3/31/15,1
non,(and goodbye -- it is quitting time now),3/31/15,1
lossyrob,adios!,3/31/15,1
lossyrob,@non btw did you get my email? I heard your coming to philly...would be great if you stopped in.,3/31/15,1
echeipesh,Not all that gitters is gold,3/31/15,1
lossyrob,hahaha,3/31/15,1
lossyrob,@echeipesh was there anything in that Catalog PR that we should keep?,4/1/15,1
echeipesh,"Looking over it again, but almost everything there had to do with refactor plan that is out the window now. So very unlikely.",4/1/15,1
lossyrob,What was that refactor plan about again?,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,"Also, I can_„Žt name things. Catalog is really just a key value store. Key is the layer ID. But also loading tiles is just a key value store, where the key is the TileID. but that one is read only. So what should the abstractions be named?",4/1/15,1
lossyrob,Reader/Writer traits.,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,Store/ReadOnlyStore ick,4/1/15,1
echeipesh,"That Catalog should not have params, only layer name is traded for RDD. Plus it was based on the type-class design that we_„Žre throwing out.",4/1/15,1
lossyrob,right,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,yeah that makes sense to just throw it out then. It was hanging around for a while and I wasn_„Žt sure if it had value,4/1/15,1
echeipesh,"We can still reference it for catalog work, but there is no way it was going to get merged now.",4/1/15,1
echeipesh,"Ok, I_„Žm going to start working on S3 catalog and sketch it out.",4/1/15,1
lossyrob,nice,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,"Basically a function that calls load(layerId: LayerId): RasterRDD[K] and save(layerId: LayerId, rdd: RasterRDD[K]): Unit for some K",4/1/15,1
echeipesh,yup,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,and perhaps a load(key: K): Tile for some TileLoader that_„Žs based on the LayerId,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,(which still not sure if we will support in HDFS),4/1/15,1
lossyrob,do you think S3 would be fine for supporting that? Probably yeah?,4/1/15,1
echeipesh,Probably,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,the other capability is to load off of a filter set,4/1/15,1
echeipesh,"yes, that_„Žs the tricky bit",4/1/15,1
lossyrob,"or like, you can create just a straight up load(key: K): V function based on injecting filters or whatever into the class that_„Žs providing that function",4/1/15,1
lossyrob,still trying to figure out if that looks ok in practice,4/1/15,1
echeipesh,"yes, I_„Žm just going to make some functions and pass things around as arguments to make it super clear for now. Will plug it into whatever makes sense.",4/1/15,1
lossyrob,```,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,woot,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,"```woot```",4/1/15,1
echeipesh,wtc ?,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,Trying to see how this markdown thing works,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,"```This is code and such```",4/1/15,1
echeipesh,```this is *code* ```,4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,It works like slack and github,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,![sfcurve-space-diagram](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2320142/6543539/449db6e2-c4ed-11e4-865a-584e056b5469.png),4/1/15,1
lossyrob,nice,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,can_„Žt do that on freenode,4/1/15,1
echeipesh,This will also tell you who read the comments,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,oh I didn_„Žt realize that,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,nice. so now I can tell who_„Žs reading my nonsense ,4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,that's kind of creepy,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,yeah now I can_„Žt pretend that I haven_„Žt read a thing,4/1/15,1
echeipesh,Merging https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/pull/1042 in since its +1,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,surely,4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,I'm trying to run tests on the spark subproject before I start cleaning up the op stuff there -- but tests are failing with an error: `java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no gdaljni in java.library.path`,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,that_„Žs fun,4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,is there a dependency I missed in installing?,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,it would be GDAL,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,but I thought we fixed it so if GDAL wasn_„Žt installed it wouldn_„Žt fail?,4/1/15,1
echeipesh,I don_„Žt recall that.,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,e.g. travis has no gdal,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,oh but it also has no spark. and doesn_„Žt run it ,4/1/15,1
echeipesh,"Yo, Rob, get back in the office",4/1/15,1
echeipesh,Monsuer wants to talk to us,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,shit,4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,"cool - I'll try that, thanks",4/1/15,1
lossyrob,"@notthatbreezy there should be a way to  check if it_„Žs installed. I either tried to do that and succeeded and for some reason that test isn_„Žt doing it, or I failed, lemme check",4/1/15,1
lossyrob,there should be a way to catch that unsatisfied link error and report that gdal_„Žs not there,4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,"ok, I can look into it too -- I install libgdal1-dev, but that doesn't seem to have fixed it either -- I can mess around with it now that I understand what's going on, this might be ubuntu specific",4/1/15,1
lossyrob,not sure the dev package installs java bindings,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,hector_„Žs gdal java ansible role installs it,4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,"got it, I'll look at what that's doing",4/1/15,1
lossyrob,"I wonder if there_„Žs a call we can make on that Gdal object, or some init all, that we can catch the UnsatisfiedLinkError from",4/1/15,1
lossyrob,that would just check if it_„Žs working,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,"and if not, we can just return false to some gdalBindingsInstalled call",4/1/15,1
lossyrob,and skip tests based on if they_„Žre not there,4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,"yeah, so that it would work similar to how the `ifCanRunSpark` check works?",4/1/15,1
echeipesh,"yeap, something like that. You would just take a function and check the precondition before you eval.",4/1/15,1
lossyrob,@notthatbreezy ,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,"```def isGdalInstalled = try { gdal.AllRegister() ; true } catch { case e: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError => false }```",4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,"cool - also, I installed the libgdal-java (following from the playbook), but that didn't fix the problem",4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,"I also used the gdal-netcdf playbook since that was the test that was throwing the error, but that didn't fix things either",4/1/15,1
lossyrob,are the library binaries installed in /usr/local/lib?,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,that_„Žs what is put into the path to search in the build file,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/project/Build.scala#L413,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,java.library.path is what it would be looking to to load the linked binary libs,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,is something called `gdaljni` in there?,4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,ah no,4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,I'll try and figure out where that is,4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,it got put in /usr/lib/jni,4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,actually - the only thing I could find is libgdaljni.so,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,that might just be it,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,i wonder why it got put there?,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,you could try to modify the java.library.path in the build file,4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,"yeah, I'm in the process of testing that",4/1/15,1
lossyrob,"perhaps that should be pushed out to an optional environment var, like the thigns in Version.scala",4/1/15,1
lossyrob,nice,4/1/15,1
echeipesh,that_„Žs not a bad idea,4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,woohoo - that worked,4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,"so yeah, seems like it's necessary to make that configurable through an environment var",4/1/15,1
lossyrob,nice,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,"also if you_„Žre gonna do a PR with that, would be good to include the isGdalInstalled stuff too",4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,"yeah, I'll work on that now -- though I do have some questions about the ops stuff that might be quicker to discuss in person when you have a second",4/1/15,1
lossyrob,yeah_„_I_„Žm caught in some coding now,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,"would be quicker, but want to do it through here for posterity_„Žs sake?",4/1/15,1
lossyrob,slash I can still focus on code,4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,ok sure - yeah good point,4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,"Let me work on this gdal stuff real quick first, then when I get to actually making changes and look at that stuff again I'll pop back on here",4/1/15,1
lossyrob,ok cool,4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,"is there a spot where environment variables are being documented in the project? -- thought about putting it in gdal/README.md, but then it'd be missed if someone was just interested in spark so the top-level README might be the best",4/1/15,1
echeipesh,I think it might be worth while breaking it out into Defaults.scala under build ?,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,makes sense to break it out_„_though not sure what that would look like,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,need to default versions and also other properties,4/1/15,1
echeipesh,"Just make it project/Defaults.scala, link to it from README",4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,ah ok - for now this would be the only thing in there I think,4/1/15,1
echeipesh,"No, the default versions for spark and hadoop would be there too I would think.",4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,"oh, did you mean Version.scala then?",4/1/15,1
lossyrob,if you look at Versions.scala you_„Žll see the _„ñeither_„ method for either using an env variable or a default,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,but it doesn_„Žt belong in Version.scala if it_„Žs not only versions,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,which we_„Žd be adding a thing that isn_„Žt a Version,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,So it_„Žs almost like a Config object that takes either from the environment or some default,4/1/15,1
echeipesh,"yeap, so move that out to Defaults.scala, and from Version you can use _„ñDefault.sparkVersion, Default.hadoopVersion""",4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,"yeah, so right now I just have that in Build.scala `val javaGdalDir = scala.util.Properties.envOrElse(""JAVA_GDAL_DIR"", ""/usr/local/lib"")`",4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,@echeipesh that seems reasonable,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,but shoudl we have Default,4/1/15,1
echeipesh,Is it Default or Environmental ?,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,or have the either() or (envOrElse) in there too,4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,"I think keeping ""/usr/local/lib"" as a default makes sense, else existing use would break",4/1/15,1
lossyrob,yeah and that_„Žs where it usually installs to_„_.I_„Žm suprised yours doesn't,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,this is on ubuntu?,4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,@echeipesh it's not environmental :smile: ,4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,"yeah, this is on ubuntu",4/1/15,1
lossyrob,hahaha,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,"well actually, the _„ñal_„ might make sense there",4/1/15,1
lossyrob,or maybe I_„Žve just caught the _„ñEnvironmental Variable_„ bug,4/1/15,1
echeipesh,"Added ```\w+(\.\w+){2,}``` as keyword to highlight in white, and it_„Žs dope",4/1/15,1
echeipesh,to iTerm2,4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,ok - I think I have some questions now about the spark op cleanup task -- the only really global method implemented is vertical flip; viewshed is half-implemented -- the plan was to nix both of these right?,4/1/15,1
moradology,"me too, me too",4/1/15,1
moradology,I'm looking through geotrellis.raster and i'm having a hard time remembering why the operations in histogram aren't in op/global,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,@moradology what operations in histogram?,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,"@notthatbreezy well, viewshed seems really hard to parallelize, so probably won_„Žt get that out before the release",4/1/15,1
lossyrob,but verticle flip_„_that seems doable yeah?,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,some clever think about key switching or something,4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,"yeah, that's what it looks like its doing now",4/1/15,1
lossyrob,oh your saying that_„Žs the only one,4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,"flips each individual tile, then re-arranges the keys",4/1/15,1
lossyrob,"right. anyhting that isn_„Žt real goes away, and is marked i guess with  a github issue for actually doing it",4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,ok got it,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,"and you can mark it as 0.10 milestone, and I_„Žll go through and see what to try to get in for the release",4/1/15,1
moradology,i was just wondering about any of the operations in `geotrellis.raster.histogram` that use the entire raster. ,4/1/15,1
moradology,"so, ArrayHistogram.fromTile",4/1/15,1
moradology,for instance,4/1/15,1
moradology,i remembered having discussed this,4/1/15,1
moradology,but don't recall what the answer was that we came to at the code sprint,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,ArrayHistogram is something that is never used,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,we always just use FastMapHistogram,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,and I think that has an operation stats,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,but yeah those are stats operations,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,and how an ArrayHistogram is constructed from a tile makes sense to be owned by the ArrayHistogram object,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,"it might be useful to expose it as an op on tile, but again we just have `.histogram` and it creates a FastMapHistogram",4/1/15,1
moradology,mhmmm.,4/1/15,1
moradology,i'm going to mostly punt on the documentation there if it isn't important for usage,4/1/15,1
moradology,i'm only going so deep anyway.,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,Yeah that makes sense. target Histogram and FastMapHistogram,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,I was thinking the Defaults.scala wouldn_„Žt change Version.scala,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,because the versions that are hard coded and don_„Žt have things that can be changed in the environment aren_„Žt really defaults,4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,"oh, true",4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,sorry - thought the conversation gravitated towards a defaults.scala and appending Version to it,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,"```object Defaults {  def either(environmentVariable: String, default: String): String =    Properties.envOrElse(environmentVariable, default)  val geotrellisVersion   = ""0.10.0-SNAPSHOT""  lazy val hadoopVersion  = either(""SPARK_HADOOP_VERSION"", ""2.5.0"")  lazy val sparkVersion   = either(""SPARK_VERSION"", ""1.2.0"")  lazy val javaGdalDir    = either(""JAVA_GDAL_DIR"", ""/usr/local/lib"")}```",4/1/15,1
lossyrob,and then in version,4/1/15,1
echeipesh,why are those versions lazy ?,4/1/15,1
echeipesh,\\\,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,well_„_also the Defaults doesn_„Žt encapsulate that it_„Žs actually pulling from the env too,4/1/15,1
echeipesh,"```object Sweet { def apply() = ???}```",4/1/15,1
lossyrob,"so I would say, `object Environment`",4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,"that makes sense too -- I don't really have a preference, other than making it clear for users what can be set from the environment",4/1/15,1
lossyrob,or `EnvOrDefault` ?,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,I hate names,4/1/15,1
echeipesh,+1 Environment,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,So then version would look like,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,"```object Version {  val geotrellis  = ""0.10.0-SNAPSHOT""  val scala       = ""2.10.4""  val geotools    = ""11.0""  val akka        = ""2.2.4""  val spray       = ""1.2.1""  val jackson     = ""1.6.1""  lazy val hadoop      = Environment.hadoopVersion  lazy val spark       = Environment.sparkVersion}```",4/1/15,1
lossyrob,(and loses the `either` function),4/1/15,1
lossyrob,oooohh i can edit eh,4/1/15,1
notthatbreezy,"cool, updated the PR",4/1/15,1
lossyrob,gratsi,4/1/15,1
hectcastro,Oh damn. Yet another scrollback!,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,"I_„Žm playing chat client bingo_„_I have Kato, Slack, IRC and Gitter on separate desktops",4/1/15,1
lossyrob,I guess I could fullscreen a google chat and make it 5,4/1/15,1
hectcastro,GitHub integration is nice though.,4/1/15,1
lossyrob,@kyeah did you get a successful ingest of that spatial raster into Cassandra?,4/2/15,1
pomadchin,"Hi guyz! Hm, mb it is question more about spark ): I'm trying to run gt-admin server (compiled it (fixed it up to new geotrellis) and it seems to run successfully), but cant it ping by 0.0.0.0:4444 (fixed port in sources) how is it possible to find logs I wonder? ._.' in console it seems to be everything ok.

lossyrob,"you run the server via the spark submit so that it runs it with the spark context. And it_„Žs a forever-lasting spark job (until you ctrl-c out of it), which listens on the port",4/2/15,1

lossyrob,You could use the NexIngest.scala as a template to build an ingest around reading up the temporal raster set that I gave the viewer team,4/3/15,1
kyeah,"I just got the SpaceTime driver working with the viewer last night, so I'll push that up to my geotrellis / gt-admin repos",4/3/15,1
kyeah,I'll look into Nexingest and get that temporal set from the team,4/3/15,1
lossyrob,wooot,4/3/15,1
lossyrob,at this pace Cassandra support might make it into the 0.10 release,4/3/15,1
notthatbreezy,"Chiming in here because I haven't done it before, but when you're talking about the one month tiles, what/where are they?",4/3/15,1
lossyrob,"it was a set of NEX data that I clipped down to one month (so it didn_„Žt need a time component, just a SpatialKey) that I gave to the UT Austin students to work with",4/3/15,1

notthatbreezy,thanks,4/3/15,1
lossyrob,"no problem, let me know if you have trouble working with them",4/3/15,1
lossyrob,but you should be able to ingest those through the current gt-admin,4/3/15,1
lossyrob,although I_„Žm not sure if there_„Žs issues with using geotrellis master,4/3/15,1
lossyrob,it might need some updating since Eugene_„Žs change to how Ingest works,4/3/15,1
lossyrob,slight updates but updates nontheless,4/3/15,1
notthatbreezy,"got it, I'll play around with it and see if there are issues (probably over the weekend)",4/3/15,1
pomadchin,"@lossyrob tried 1.5.2 accumulo and ingesting works (with geotrellis master assembly) perfect; btw still got errors while spary starting (gt-admin) :D but, it seems to me I know where to look.Dat incompatibility ):",4/4/15,1
lossyrob,"@pomadchin yeah, there_„Žs problems with upgrading to 1.6_„_cloudera doesn_„Žt have a package for it, and so getting a standard install is tough. Is there a particular reason for you to use 1.6 instead of 1.5?",4/4/15,1
pomadchin,"@lossyrob nope, the only reason I used 1.6.x that I'm new to it, and didn't know what to use",4/4/15,1
lossyrob,"We have a PR to support 1.6, but are also worried about deployment support for 1.6",4/4/15,1

lossyrob,Strange about the spray not working. I wonder if you can get another spray project to run?,4/4/15,1

DarkManiel,it was in chrome. ,4/6/15,1
DarkManiel,deleted now though,4/6/15,1

st028,"Hey @lossyrob, just made the fix that you suggested on #1044, tests are still failing unfortunately",4/6/15,1
lossyrob,@st028 the tests that were failing because of the varying resolution are still failing after the extent reprojection fix? ,4/6/15,1
pomadchin,"//offtop// Is it possible to get out already ingested tiff, and save it somewhere else (out of hdfs)? (I loaded it, and the to get it out? noticed png render functions) In other words got misunderstand a little what exactly stores accumulo, only metadata or the whole image data?",4/6/15,1
st028,@lossyrob Yep,4/6/15,1
lossyrob,"@st028 ok, something to debugged then. Is there a test around extent reprojection that maybe mimics what we were doing with the JTS builder that will help you debug?",4/6/15,1
lossyrob,"@pomadchin accumulo or hdfs stores all the image data (in a format that I specific to he back end, mainly a byte array) as well as metadata. You can load a layer out of one catalog and save it to another. Rendering PNGs happens at the Tile level (e.g. for returning PNGs from a TMS web request).",4/6/15,1
DarkManiel,"It looks like I'm missing some of the tiles. I get ""Error during processing of request HttpRequest(GET,http://localhost:8088/tms/nexmonth_gtadmin/3/3/4?breaks=278,280,282,283,284,285,286,288,289,291,293,300 ...

lossyrob,"that might just be that that tile doesn_„Žt exist. Like, the TMS request doesn_„Žt know whether or not the tile (say it_„Žs requqesting china or something) doesn_„Žt exist in the layer. So the request goes through and you get that _„ƒerror_„Ž message",4/6/15,1
lossyrob,perhaps gt-admin shouldn_„Žt throw the error and just either report the tile doesn_„Žt exist and return a transparent PNG. maybe just log in for DEBUG level,4/6/15,1
lossyrob,"hey @Pshrub, so you got into the leader instance ok now?",4/6/15,1
lossyrob,Pasting in some chat I_„Žm having with @notthatbreezy about HDFS support:,4/6/15,1
lossyrob,"@lossyrobwe have this in master: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/io/hadoop/PreFilteredHadoopRDD.scalawhich is a hacked together thing that_„Žs basically a copy of Spark codethat is set to private in spark, which is annoying and makes it harder to extentso maybe there_„Žs a better way to do it? or maybe that_„Žs just what we do? or maybe we don_„Žt support filtering? The latter would be the way to do it if really there_„Žs no good way around it.",4/6/15,1
notthatbreezy,"ok yeah, that makes sense -- so this would something similar to how predicate push downs/filters work with like Cassandra, just directly on top of HDFS?",4/6/15,1
lossyrob,"this is RE: whether or not we can support filtering our RasterRDD_„Žs on load with the HDFS backend (geotrellis.spark.io.hadoop). We can do that in Accumulo, but that_„Žs because we index the tiles and Accumulo can handle the range queries",4/6/15,1
lossyrob,yeah_„_like how we do in Accumulo,4/6/15,1
lossyrob,"but the mechanism would necessarily have to be different_„_the main problem is, we don_„Žt want to load up a partition if the partition doesn_„Žt have any keys in our query",4/6/15,1
lossyrob,and we don_„Žt want to load any tiles with keys that don_„Žt match out query,4/6/15,1
lossyrob,the crux is here: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/rdd/NewHadoopRDD.scala#L157,4/6/15,1
lossyrob,"in order to read the key, we need to read the value as well. In NewHadoopRDD",4/6/15,1
echeipesh,In this context partition would be an HDFS block (which will have multiple key-tile pairs),4/6/15,1
lossyrob,our PreFilteredHadoopRDD is a version of that which doesn_„Žt necessarily load a partition or a value,4/6/15,1
notthatbreezy,"ok, yeah the use-case/need makes sense",4/6/15,1
echeipesh,Now that I know more about Hadoop I think it_„Žs likely we can push the filter down into InputFormat somehow. Maybe extend hadoop FileInputFormat.,4/6/15,1
lossyrob,hmmm truth,4/6/15,1
lossyrob,right. Ok I think that_„Žs a really good option,4/6/15,1
lossyrob,It_„Žs a Reader per map file right?,4/6/15,1
echeipesh,correct,4/6/15,1
lossyrob,"And the input format could get the splits, and check if the mapfile has any keys at all, or could contain tiles in the range?",4/6/15,1
echeipesh,"Yeah, that should happen at the point of creating splits. It should have the _„ñsplits_„ array available to it at that point.",4/6/15,1
echeipesh,"That_„Žs the part I haven_„Žt looked into yet though, but sounds like it slots into that part of API overall.",4/6/15,1
notthatbreezy,"ok, that makes sense too -- so I guess my task then is to check this out tomorrow?",4/6/15,1
lossyrob,"@notthatbreezy ok I think the support can happen, but it requires some deeper knowledge of InputFormat and RecordReaders",4/6/15,1
notthatbreezy,yeah - I can't really say I have either of those at the moment,4/6/15,1
lossyrob,so I_„Žm wondering if one of us should do it,4/6/15,1
echeipesh,I keep forgetting notthatbreezy is Chris ...,4/6/15,1
lossyrob,haha,4/6/15,1
notthatbreezy,"yeah, just not that chris brown",4/6/15,1
lossyrob,I think with one day it would be a tough task to  take on. perhaps next sprint? Unless one of us solves it before that,4/6/15,1
lossyrob,or you take on some extracarricular studies :),4/6/15,1
echeipesh,"It would be optimistic for it to be a day TBH, FileInputFormat is a work-horse so there is a lot around it.",4/6/15,1
lossyrob,yeah. Hopefully extensible,4/6/15,1
lossyrob,seems like somethign someone should have done at some point,4/6/15,1
notthatbreezy,"yeah, I didn't mean I could finish it in a day, but maybe get a good jump on it",4/6/15,1
lossyrob,"when we were researching it, we were looking at a spark specfic solution",4/6/15,1
lossyrob,which is why the PreFilteredHadoopRDD came into being,4/6/15,1
lossyrob,but an InputFormat solution may already be kicking around in the open-source-o-sphere,4/6/15,1
echeipesh,That_„Žs optimistic too : ),4/6/15,1
lossyrob,"We_„Žre looking for a `org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.lib.input.SequenceFileInputFormat[K, V]` which allows keys to be filtered out such that the value is not actually read",4/6/15,1
lossyrob,"@echeipesh, so as far as the GeoTiff reader thing goes. I had a long convo with Johan, found out a bunch of stuff_„_what were the questions you had around that?",4/6/15,1
notthatbreezy,Well I can start on the spark documentation too tomorrow -- is there a good place to start (bottom-up?) that won't become irrelevant after some branches out there get merged?,4/6/15,1
echeipesh,Is it possible to back a Tile with GeoTiff bytearray like we talked about and do you know about how to do it or should I continue my reading on the topic.,4/6/15,1
notthatbreezy,"Like I know the catalog stuff, etc. is still in flux so nothing there -- but I'm not sure what else is kicking around on other branches",4/6/15,1
lossyrob,@notthatbreezy catalog stuff is in flux for sure,4/6/15,1
lossyrob,the operations aren_„Žt as much,4/6/15,1
lossyrob,Nor is RasterRDD,4/6/15,1
lossyrob,and what it means to have different key types_„_which really are just SpatialKey and SpaceTimeKey,4/6/15,1
notthatbreezy,"ok cool, yeah - that sounds like a good place to start",4/6/15,1
lossyrob,and what the difference is between RasterRDD[SpatialKey] and RasterRDD[SpaceTimekey],4/6/15,1
lossyrob,@echeipesh yeah I think so,4/6/15,1
lossyrob,so GeoTiffs can either be stored as strips or tiles,4/6/15,1
lossyrob,each of those could be decompressed independently ,4/6/15,1
lossyrob,although there would have to be some serious refactors to the reader to get that to happen,4/6/15,1
lossyrob,a `get and `getDouble` could be implemented,4/6/15,1
lossyrob,"but mainly we_„Žd encourage the use of `foreach( z => z)` or `foreach( (col, row, z) => z)`",4/6/15,1
lossyrob,and do the decompress in a smart way,4/6/15,1
lossyrob,then there_„Žs the way that the strips and tiles of the geotiff bytes deal with multiple bands,4/6/15,1
lossyrob,"We couldn_„Žt nail that down by the end of our talk, but I have some tests that can shake that stuff out",4/6/15,1
lossyrob,which I wanna get to once the catalog stuff is done,4/6/15,1
echeipesh,"cool, much better place to be than originally.",4/6/15,1
lossyrob,but yeah there should be a way to have a Tile backed by a set of compressed pieces of the raster,4/6/15,1
lossyrob,which I think is a pretty cool thing to move towards anyway,4/6/15,1
echeipesh,"Yes, I can see it having a lot of magical properties.",4/6/15,1
lossyrob,"We_„Žd have to get the geotiff writer up to speed with the writing. Even if we only supported like ZLib compression on write. Then if you do a tile.map call, it can return a likewise compressed tile",4/6/15,1
lossyrob,"@echeipesh am I write in my code reading, if there are no SpatialFilters set for an Accumulo load (on the try3 branch), then no time range will be set, even if hter eare time filters?",4/6/15,1
lossyrob,write = right. ha.,4/6/15,1
echeipesh,"Not supposed to be that way, not really a widely tested case though.",4/6/15,1
lossyrob,ok cool. Just making sure I wasn_„Žt reading it wrong.,4/7/15,1
lossyrob,@echeipesh why does `S3InputSplit` extend `Writable`? https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/44a22acd771451ea59e7228c96423b1b93e94733/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/io/s3/S3InputSplit.scala#L12,4/7/15,1
echeipesh," It gets serialized through Hadoop api, made on the driver, sent to workers. Not sure where that mechanism is specifically though.",4/7/15,1
lossyrob,hmm ok. So I_„Žll know if I need it for the Filtered split (if that_„Žs the route I go) if it tries to serailize it and it blows up I guess,4/7/15,1
echeipesh,"Would be good to know what blows up, you working on HDFS catalog?",4/7/15,1
lossyrob,"yeah. I have a bead on the filtered thing, trying to knock it out",4/7/15,1
lossyrob,there_„Žs actually something very close to what we need,4/7/15,1
lossyrob,https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/trunk/hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/mapreduce/lib/input/SequenceFileInputFilter.java,4/7/15,1
lossyrob,But it doesn_„Žt have a mechanism to know what key ranges are in the split so it can just wholly skip the file,4/7/15,1
lossyrob,which is what I_„Žd want to add as an InputSplit,4/7/15,1
lossyrob,and inputSplit that knew it_„Žs key range. so hasNext would just return nothing if there_„Žs no keys in range,4/7/15,1
lossyrob,or getSplits could just filter those out on the InputFormat,4/7/15,1
lossyrob,confused about how I get the split ranges to the getSplits call,4/7/15,1
echeipesh,"It's really hard to read on the phone, but looks promising ",4/7/15,1
lossyrob,"yeah at this point I think there_„Žs a way to at least do it without loading Tiles, but pretty sure there_„Žs a way to do it with skipping whole files as well",4/7/15,1
pomadchin,"hm, to the question of getting out ingested tiles: i've loaded geotiff (only 1, not map), zommed ingest. It is al ok, catalog.metaDataCatalog.fetchAll gets all metadata, nut how can i get this loaded tile (without rendering to png / with, the whole loaded image I mean)? tried so: ```val layer = LayerId(name, zoom)val (lmd, params) = catalog.metaDataCatalog.load(layer)val md = lmd.rasterMetaDataval crs = md.crsval p = Point(x, y).reproject(LatLng, crs)val key = md.mapTransform(p)val tile = catalog.loadTile(layer, SpatialKey(key.col, key.row))```where x and y coords of loaded geotiff center (which r equal to metadata stored in accumulo);worked for zoom = 1 , 2 so decided to bruteforce, and got very strange results :D ```for (zoom <- 1 to 8; row <- 0 to 256; col <- 0 to 256) Try { ... } ```Moreover, i wrote this tile (if sucess) into file ``` Files.write(Paths.get(s""/tmp/$zoom-$row-$col-mod09a1.png""), tile.renderPng.bytes)```Hm, there (in some success files) not an rgb image, but mono channeled (o_O) ): mb there is an ingesting issue, due to 8 layered geotiff file? And it is interesting to get default tiff (like before accumulo ingesting) back from accumulo (as an experiment, as big tiff (mb tiff byte array))Im missing smth? o:",4/7/15,1
pomadchin,"And what r images that i get such way? https://www.dropbox.com/s/6epnmbzsslovzh4/8-46-111-test.png?dl=0default image: https://www.dropbox.com/s/uag1zqjqzmztl1n/MD20150010706.tif?dl=0 ",4/7/15,1
lossyrob,@pomadchin..are you saying your GeoTIFF file is 8 bands?,4/7/15,1
lossyrob,The logic looks correct (you can use `tile.renderPng.write(path)` though),4/7/15,1
lossyrob,This logic isn_„Žt sound though,4/7/15,1
lossyrob,for (zoom <- 1 to 8; row <- 0 to 256; col <- 0 to 256),4/7/15,1
lossyrob,"SpatialKey(col, row) is the column and row of the tile in the TMS tiling scheme",4/7/15,1
lossyrob,not the pixel col row,4/7/15,1
lossyrob,so `0 to 256` doesn_„Žt make sense in that scheme,4/7/15,1
lossyrob,the ingest process tiles up the raster,4/7/15,1
lossyrob,even if it_„Žs just one raster,4/7/15,1
lossyrob,into 256 x 256 tiles,4/7/15,1
lossyrob,so the tile you pull out with `loadTile` is the one 256x256 tile that matches that point. which at zoom level 8 is going to be a small part of your whole image,4/7/15,1
lossyrob,also to note: we don_„Žt currently support multiband,4/7/15,1
lossyrob,so you would need to export the 8 band geotiff into single band geotiffs (with GDAL perhaps),4/7/15,1
lossyrob,and then ingest each band as it_„Žs own layer,4/7/15,1
lossyrob,"`LayerId(_„ñimage-band1_„, 8)`, `LayerId(_„ñimage-band2_„, 8)` and whatnot",4/7/15,1
lossyrob,some changes upcoming are going to support multiband in a better way. but for now you have to view them as separate layers,4/7/15,1
lossyrob,i.e. separate ingests,4/7/15,1
lossyrob,"__Note__ I made a feature branch on the `geotrellis` org repo called `feature/catalog-refactor`, which has my catalog changes. They_„Žre pretty breaking, but we_„Žre going to be merging that in at some point in the near future, so be aware.",4/7/15,1
pomadchin,"@lossyrob thx alot for answers; about multi band yes, wanted to ask a little later. Thx for cols & rows in a spatial key explanation! awesome. It clears eveythiexactly the files (images avobe): the source is geotiff (rgb composite (1 layer)). and the output is the result (some part of the source tiff)what this output png means?

lossyrob,@pomadchin were you saying that the gt-admin works with `1.2.1` if we use the `2.3.4-spark` akka projects?,4/9/15,1
lossyrob,because those might conflict with the `spray` dependencies we have as well,4/9/15,1
lossyrob,"@pomadchin also, PNG output = whatever TMS tiles are. A flat PNG file, should open in an image viewer. If you want RGB tiff, we don_„Žt have that yet.

pomadchin,"@DarkManiel to check spark version possible by runing ```spark-shell``` In the output (while shell init) you will see smth like ```Welcome to      ____              __     / __/__  ___ _____/ /__    _\ \/ _ \/ _ `/ __/  '_/   /___/ .__/\_,_/_/ /_/\_\   version 1.1.1      /_/```",4/10/15,1

lossyrob,"Hey @echeipesh, here_„Žs that index work that I did: https://gist.github.com/lossyrob/04acaf1d6e98c5dcfc2d",4/10/15,1
lossyrob,I_„Žm going to concentrate on the hadoop filter beyond the index stuff if you wanna pick that up.,4/10/15,1
echeipesh,"kk, will check it out, thanks.",4/10/15,1
lossyrob,"@pomadchin Not sure what you mean that geotiff writer does not support normal mercator projection? You pass in a CRS, and so it should be able to write any raster of any projection.",4/10/15,1
lossyrob,"@pomadchin also, the degredation you mention has to do with our ingest process, where we reproject, resample and tile the input raster according to the TMS zoom layout we_„Žre ingesting at, and the projection that is the target projection of the ingested raster",4/10/15,1
lossyrob,watching the portion of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=802-vNEFQtg where @echeipesh describes the ingest process might help,4/10/15,1
echeipesh,"Yeay, it is useful : )",4/10/15,1
lossyrob,"@echeipesh whenever you go over it, notice https://gist.github.com/lossyrob/04acaf1d6e98c5dcfc2d#file-index-gt-uzaygezen-scala-L211 line 211_„_.we can_„Žt have the index invertable to a SpaceTimeKey since the SpaceTimeKey is an instant inside of a binned block of time; perhaps have to have some intermediate key index like we were talking about, where time has a layout also. Or perhaps we don_„Žt need index to really have that function. Not sure the solution there. SpatialIndex translates to a SpatialKey, but the index of N-dimensional space translates to a specifc col, row, but also a block of time that shouldn_„Žt be represented as a single instant (I know you know that, repeating for the crowd)",4/10/15,1
echeipesh,love the picture placement there,4/10/15,1
lossyrob,grrrrr,4/10/15,1
lossyrob,"I don_„Žt know if I have the original pic that_„Žs from but it_„Žs pretty great, I_„Žll have to look it up",4/10/15,1
echeipesh,"Yes, I don_„Žt really know how to deal with that problem in the abstract. Unless I find a way to squerl away abritrary information in the mapping process I_„Žll probably explore the Cube raster instead of raster stack idea where the cube could be sparse.",4/10/15,1
lossyrob,well we don_„Žt have to necessarily have the invertable function produce a key,4/10/15,1
lossyrob,"I def don_„Žt want to slog off the stack support though, or go in a direction where we_„Žre not coding to that use case from the start",4/10/15,1
echeipesh,"Right, we just need to have some mechanism to restore the full metadata",4/10/15,1
lossyrob,"that_„Žs like the column qualifier in Accumulo, where the actual key is created off of more data then the reverse of the index",4/10/15,1
echeipesh,Exactly,4/10/15,1
lossyrob,"it just turns out that for spatial tiles, the reverse of hte index is sufficient to hydrate the hwole key",4/10/15,1
lossyrob,"so really it_„Žs like there_„Žs an intermediate thing in the index, that it inverts to",4/10/15,1
lossyrob,liek a grid coord,4/10/15,1
lossyrob,"@echeipesh when you were saying that the getSplits call should take in the key splits, or read in the file that has the key splits, is there a good way to get that path to getSplits that you know of",4/10/15,1
lossyrob,seems like it_„Žs just going to be a lot of setting things into the job config,4/10/15,1
echeipesh,"Thats pretty much the way. But why a lot? That_„Žs just splits path appended to input path, right?",4/10/15,1
lossyrob,because the filter,4/10/15,1
lossyrob,"and we don_„Žt get input path, we get input paths",4/10/15,1
lossyrob,"well, at least how we_„Žre doing it now. with the wildcarding",4/10/15,1
lossyrob,"`final val SEQFILE_GLOB = ""/*[0-9]*/data_„` is what we attach to the input path when we_„Žre setting it into the config, so inputsplits gets a bunch of data file paths",4/10/15,1
echeipesh,"But for one raster, right ?",4/10/15,1
lossyrob,yeah,4/10/15,1
echeipesh,"So there should only be one splits file, you can just place that into the config.",4/10/15,1
lossyrob,right,4/10/15,1
lossyrob,but also I_„Žll have to place filter information,4/10/15,1
lossyrob,"so that_„Žs why I said, a lot of putting stuff into the config",4/10/15,1
echeipesh,"Ah, right",4/10/15,1
lossyrob,it_„Žs the only way to actually communicate with the InputFormat,4/10/15,1
lossyrob,which I just need to get over and lean on haha,4/10/15,1
echeipesh,I haven_„Žt seen anything else. Like InputFormat gets instantiated through reflection so it can_„Žt even have a constructor.,4/10/15,1
lossyrob,yeah. shouldn_„Žt be too bad once I get used to how to pass stuff through the conf,4/10/15,1
lossyrob,I_„Žm gonna have a similar challenge to the serialization/deserialization of the index when I need to store and retreive the FilterSet,4/10/15,1
lossyrob,I_„Žm wondering if we can solve both of those in one shot,4/10/15,1
lossyrob,or have some abstraction over the mechanism to do that sort of thing_„_type based instantiation of different subclasses of a thing,4/10/15,1
echeipesh,"Could you handle index through reflection, in similar manner to InputFormat? Or do you have a better idea ?",4/10/15,1
lossyrob,no I mean just JSON serialization/deserialization,4/10/15,1
lossyrob,we_„Žd have to ship it to the config by the same method if we needed it in the InputFormat,4/10/15,1
echeipesh,"Yeah, as long as it_„Žs an untyped interface, right ?",4/10/15,1
lossyrob,don_„Žt know what you mean about hta,4/10/15,1
echeipesh,When you deserialize the JSON you need to produce an object with an interface that does not have type parameters.,4/10/15,1
lossyrob,That_„Žs not necessarily true,4/10/15,1
lossyrob,I do that with the KeyBounds in accumulo package,4/10/15,1
echeipesh,I_„Žll check that out,4/10/15,1

echeipesh,"Oh right, but you know to ask for specific K, sure",4/10/15,1
lossyrob,"right. and in the index and filter case, I_„Žll know what the K is",4/10/15,1
lossyrob,because it_„Žll be worked with inside the `reader[K]` or `writer[K]` functions,4/10/15,1
echeipesh,"ok, makes sense.",4/10/15,1
lossyrob,"here_„Žs a concern I_„Žm stumbling on_„_.MapFiles don_„Žt provide a way to just read the next key, need to read the key and value at the same time",4/10/15,1
lossyrob,"it_„Žs like, MapFile is a wrapper over a sequence file, but doesn_„Žt provide all the functionality of a sequence file",4/10/15,1

ejc123,I'm far from an expert on this stuff :-),4/20/15,1
lossyrob,Hmm right. So maybe you_„Žre actually creating a 3 band raster out of a larger band raster?,4/20/15,1

echeipesh,basically if there are no filters it needs to know to snap to the zoom level for the row filter,4/22/15,1
lossyrob,where is the spatial filter in the code you linked to?,4/22/15,1
lossyrob,"Also I see how it *is* doing default filtering, I just don_„Žt think it needs to",4/22/15,1
moradology,ah. cool,4/22/15,1
lossyrob,we do need to do the zoom level filter,4/22/15,1
lossyrob,"but that_„Žs actually always the case, and the same between keys. So perhaps it_„Žs if(filterSet.isEmpty { do the zoom filter } else { do the key specific filtering }",4/22/15,1
lossyrob,oh right I see the `FilterRanges.spatioTemporal` does the space filter thing,4/22/15,1
lossyrob,and then the temoral filter for the accumulo filterable iterator is set afer taht,4/22/15,1
lossyrob,"and yeah, if it_„Žs `None`, wouldn_„Žt have to actually set that iterator",4/22/15,1
moradology,"okay, cool",4/22/15,1
moradology,"i can totally do that, i've been erring conservative with the refactor",4/22/15,1
lossyrob,"gotcha, yeah that would be good. thanks.",4/22/15,1
lossyrob,actually,4/22/15,1
lossyrob,we were talking about making zoom level tables,4/22/15,1
lossyrob,"like, because of the way things are indexed, you really shouldn_„Žt have tiles in the same table that are of different zoom levels",4/22/15,1
lossyrob,so we need to make tables per zoom level,4/22/15,1
moradology,that makes sense to me,4/22/15,1
lossyrob,not sure what the best way to do that is.,4/22/15,1
moradology,might be a good thing to have for RRP tomorrow,4/22/15,1
pomadchin,"@lossyrob lil bit off top but about zoom in a ```scala LayerId```what about this pyramid parameter? https://gist.github.com/lossyrob/fda457994a4be6db598c#file-ingest-spatial-sh-L22how to get tiles loaded with pyramid false?",4/22/15,1
lossyrob,"if you don_„Žt pyramid, it still imports at a specific zoom level",4/22/15,1
lossyrob,it finds the closest zoom level to the native resolution N,4/22/15,1
lossyrob,and then ingests it,4/22/15,1
pomadchin,oh,4/22/15,1
pomadchin,ty,4/22/15,1
lossyrob,"if Pyramiding, then it does the same for N - 1, N - 2, _„_, 1",4/22/15,1

lossyrob,your very welcome!,4/22/15,1
notthatbreezy,@lossyrob figured out the setting -- spark.mesos.extra.cores,4/23/15,1
notthatbreezy,"bumped it up just now, got the ingest down to 12 minutes -- still hadn't maxed out the CPU so I'm going to push it even further",4/23/15,1
lossyrob,wow,4/23/15,1
lossyrob,this is still on one node?,4/23/15,1
notthatbreezy,"2 nodes, 16 cores actually",4/23/15,1
lossyrob,oh ok,4/23/15,1
lossyrob,how long did it take without that setting?,4/23/15,1
notthatbreezy,24 minutes,4/23/15,1
lossyrob,nice,4/23/15,1
notthatbreezy,"I bumped it up just now so it was running with 35 tasks in parallel, average time per task was still 3.5 minutes per second so I think there's still room to go, going to try again",4/23/15,1
notthatbreezy,"sorry, 3.5 minutes per task",4/23/15,1
lossyrob,"so, if there_„Žs more cores in that setting then actual cores, and there_„Žs CPU not being utilized, it_„Žll actually do the context switching on a thread pool I guess?",4/23/15,1
notthatbreezy,"yeah, that's my understanding, I'm not actually sure how it works 100 percent on mesos -- on standalone cluster, the number of cores you set is the number of executors that get launched by the worker node",4/23/15,1
notthatbreezy,if you're on the Azavea VPN you can check the difference in CPU utilization here: http://ec2-52-8-4-42.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8090/#dashboard/temp/AUzj9qsErrpZpZjH7yTs,4/23/15,1
lossyrob,that_„Žs a pretty sweet visualization,4/23/15,1
notthatbreezy,"the first group is the 13 minute run, the second group is the run now",4/23/15,1
notthatbreezy,that time it took 4 minutes,4/23/15,1
lossyrob,![ClusterUsage](http://i.imgur.com/RKPr7F6.png),4/23/15,1
notthatbreezy,and was pretty much as parallel as it could get - it started all 111 tasks at the same time,4/23/15,1
notthatbreezy,"nice, yeah good idea with the screenshot",4/23/15,1
lossyrob,what do you mean _„ñgroup_„?,4/23/15,1
notthatbreezy,the first set from 9:30ish until 9:40ish was when I ran it with 36 tasks in parallel -- total time was about 13 minutes (first group),4/23/15,1
notthatbreezy,"the second group, that started at 9:45ish was when I ran it will 111 tasks in parallel for the spark job and took about 4 minutes from start to finish",4/23/15,1
lossyrob,![better-shot](http://i.imgur.com/9CaBXVE.png),4/23/15,1
lossyrob,there_„Žs a better shot of the difference,4/23/15,1
notthatbreezy,yeah,4/23/15,1
lossyrob,"you mean, a whole ingest?",4/23/15,1
lossyrob,in 4 minutes?,4/23/15,1
notthatbreezy,it's the ingest command I got from eugene,4/23/15,1

notthatbreezy,"ugh, can't get the formatting right",4/23/15,1
lossyrob,haha that_„Žs fine. i know hte command,4/23/15,1
lossyrob,just suprised at the time,4/23/15,1
lossyrob,but yeah are you still on 2 nodes?,4/23/15,1
notthatbreezy,"yeah, 2 nodes, 8 cores each",4/23/15,1
lossyrob,what happens if you bring it up to like 8? I wonder how fast you can get it,4/23/15,1
lossyrob,We were doing 20 nodes at some point too. I think the ingest still took a couple of minutes,4/23/15,1
notthatbreezy,"I'm not sure much faster, it's still not using all of the CPU for the 2 nodes I have up now ... I guess there's only one way to find out",4/23/15,1
lossyrob,yeah. pedal to the metal.,4/23/15,1
echeipesh,That's impressive,4/23/15,1
lossyrob,"We_„Žre eventually going to want to do parallel ingests, say of two layers simultaniously that we_„Žll want to run operations on. not sure if they woudl be part of the same or different spark submit job, or what the consequences would be of having the two jobs running simultaniously. something to test out",4/23/15,1
lossyrob,yeah but ingesting 1 layer 2 nodes 4 minutes is great. Are you recording these? We_„Žll need ingest timing stats for the whitepaper,4/23/15,1
notthatbreezy,I'll take the numbers down now,4/23/15,1
notthatbreezy,"Yeah, over-subscribing the CPU so much may not make sense if there are multiple spark jobs being submitted, though mesos will at least hold off on simultaneous jobs if there isn't enough resources in the cluster to satisfy the offer",4/23/15,1
lossyrob,hmm yeah_„_wondering how Mesos would behave as we increase the number of submitted ingest jobs from 1 -> crazy,4/23/15,1
notthatbreezy,would also want to play around with fine-grained vs. coarse-grained mode in a multi-user/multi-job environment I think so one long-running job doesn't block all other jobs from running,4/23/15,1
lossyrob,"I remember there being a lot of frustrated talk about fine grained vs coarse grained mode by @hectcastro and @echeipesh, though that may have gotten sorted out",4/23/15,1
notthatbreezy,"yeah, so I have the number of cores it's requesting == to the number of the cores in the cluster now so other jobs would be blocked until it finishes",4/23/15,1
lossyrob,there was a problem with running fine grained mode. it_„Žs running coarse grain right?,4/23/15,1
lossyrob,not sure what that issue was or if we can do fine grained now,4/23/15,1
notthatbreezy,"I think fine-grained mode makes each task a new mesos job, which there's quite a bit of overhead for something like this in that case, but may be better in a multi-user setting -- yeah, it's coarse-grained",4/23/15,1
notthatbreezy,would be interested to learn more about @echeipesh and @hectcastro experience with that though,4/23/15,1
echeipesh,"That was solved, it's 5% slower to run in fine grained, but it works",4/23/15,1
lossyrob,ah gotcha,4/23/15,1
lossyrob,"so yeah as  we go 1 -> crazy that % may change from negative to positive, I guess we_„Žll see",4/23/15,1
hectcastro,Nice. IRC gateway for Gitter works.,4/23/15,1
lossyrob,Nice. but then you_„Žll miss out on all the sweet emoji_„Žs yeah? :poop: ,4/23/15,1
hectcastro,Some decisions are easier to make than others.,4/23/15,1

lossyrob,I can_„Žt tell if that_„Žs a bad idea or not. @echeipesh @ejc123 @Pshrub thoughts?,4/23/15,1
echeipesh,@lossyrob did we ever agree if FilterSet can have disjoint spaces? ,4/23/15,1
echeipesh,So for instance can we have multiple time fitlers ?,4/23/15,1
lossyrob,I don_„Žt think we explicitly agreed. But I did read the code that that was possible,4/23/15,1
lossyrob,like you could specify multiple ranges,4/23/15,1
echeipesh,"re: band indexing, unless there is some encoding reason, like we need to match some metadata with band index I would prefer to stick to 0-index. Every time I_„Žve seen a library trying to match a specific domain it was confusing as all hell.",4/23/15,1
lossyrob,I don_„Žt know how useful that is. but the current functionality lets that happen,4/23/15,1
echeipesh,"Ok, then we have a problem with that.",4/23/15,1
lossyrob,"If we don_„Žt allow that, then the FilterSet is kind of weird. Like it_„Žs a collection when it_„Žs really not, sort of",4/23/15,1
lossyrob,"I was thinking about how to change that, or if it should change. and then I stopped thinking about it.",4/23/15,1
lossyrob,but it_„Žs a good question,4/23/15,1
echeipesh,this will never be true for disjoint ranges: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/feature/catalog-refactor/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/FilterSet.scala#L17,4/23/15,1
lossyrob,that is very true,4/23/15,1
echeipesh,I think I know how to fix it actually,4/23/15,1
echeipesh,It_„Žs super simple,4/23/15,1
lossyrob,"it_„Žs almost like you want an || between filters that have the same key, and && for filters that have different keys, ya know?",4/23/15,1
echeipesh,So I think FilterSet actually maps to a set of KeyBounds which is a cartisian product of spatial filters and temporal filters.,4/23/15,1
lossyrob,"well, if we type it specifically to spatial and temporal, then we should just hose the whole generic thing",4/23/15,1
lossyrob,the thing about this setup is that it is generic on K,4/23/15,1

The compiler is telling us, ok, I have a (LayerMetaData, TableName) type, and your asking me for something that has a mapTransform method, and this def isn_„Žt it. You could inspect the types your getting back, and see that LayerMetaData.rasterMetaData actually has what your looking for, so then use the appropriate proerties to get at the mapTransform.",4/30/15,1

lossyrob,"@DarkManiel a good way to have found that out is, if you_„Žre looking for what has a method call, `grep` the codebase (or use [ag, the silver searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher), which is super fast and awesome) for that method name, and look for declarations.

lossyrob,for sure,4/30/15,1
notthatbreezy,"we ran the ingest on a big cluster (112 cores, about 800GB of memory (don't worry, used spot instances so it was cheap)) -- but the writing to accumulo still took about 40 minutes",4/30/15,1

lossyrob,tbh not very familiar with react so not sure which part is the problem area,5/4/15,1
DarkManiel,"well, values is really just an array (from val values = mutable.ListBuffer[String]()), but I think I need to just display it as an array of arrays based on the number of rows and columns, or at least that's what I was planning on doing",5/4/15,1
lossyrob,ok. so the question is how in react do you convert your array to that grid. I_„Žd have to look at the react code to try to figure that out. do you have it up on a branch?,5/4/15,1
DarkManiel,"No, but I can push it",5/4/15,1
DarkManiel,https://github.com/DarkManiel/gt-admin/blob/modal_grid/viewer/src/scripts/components/ValueGrid.jsx,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,cool looking now.,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,"ps, should have forked from geotrellis/gt-admin, not from my fork of it",5/4/15,1
DarkManiel,"Basically, I have an array of values under this.props.values and want to stick it into elemenets of columns (gridTh)  which are then rendered into rows (gridTr)",5/4/15,1
DarkManiel,"oh okay, thanks",5/4/15,1
DarkManiel,"the code is still a bit messy, so let me know if you have any questions ",5/4/15,1
lossyrob,oh ok,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,so you have access to the values,5/4/15,1
DarkManiel,yeah,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,and you just need to figure out how to turn it into the array of arrays,5/4/15,1
DarkManiel,exactly,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,"oh, ok. fun",5/4/15,1
lossyrob,do you know the number of cols and rows,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,or even jsut number of cols,5/4/15,1
DarkManiel,"but it's a little tricky with react. Yeah... I mean I have to add that in on the scala side and carry it through, but I know how to do it",5/4/15,1
lossyrob,"is the values the same size always from teh service, or when there_„Žs like cropping (i.e. click on a border pixel) it_„Žll have less values",5/4/15,1
lossyrob,you could just return it as an array of arrays in scala,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,"so you hit that endpoint and get { _„ƒvalues_„Ž : [ row1, row2 ] }",5/4/15,1
lossyrob,etc,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,but you can totally do it in js,5/4/15,1
DarkManiel,"Yeah, I think the size varies",5/4/15,1
lossyrob,"so just to be clear. are we talking about, how we actually get the values when the pixel is clicked? or just, starting from we have the values, being able to use them in the render func",5/4/15,1
DarkManiel,just being able to use them in the render function,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,ok,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,"so we can boil the problem down to, given an array of values, if that array of values describes the values of rows that are `rows` across, how do we transform that into an array of arrays, which represent the row values",5/4/15,1
DarkManiel,I figured out how to get the values.... I rigged it to always give the same values right now though.... just for testing,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,"so to write it in scala, just because writing typed methods can be helpful```def valuesToRows(vales: Array[Double], rows: Int): Array[Array[Double]]```",5/4/15,1
lossyrob,is what you need,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,right?,5/4/15,1
DarkManiel,"Yeah I think that looks right. so then in the react code above, how would I specify the .map functions using the array of arrays? what would I use as the parameters of the two .map functions?",5/4/15,1
lossyrob,"ok, let_„Žs inspect that",5/4/15,1
lossyrob,"say our values were [1, 2, 3, 4], and our row size was 2",5/4/15,1
lossyrob,"the way you have it, `gridTr` would produce 4 rows",5/4/15,1
lossyrob,if you were to pass the values into that function,5/4/15,1
DarkManiel,okay,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,which doesn_„Žt seem right.,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,"Also, because the `gridTh` is a static var, it would return the same thing for each row",5/4/15,1
lossyrob,"but we want each of our `gridTr`_„Žs to be different, namely the values of each row",5/4/15,1
lossyrob,"so for our example, `[1, 2]` and `[3, 4]`",5/4/15,1
DarkManiel,yeah,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,ok. so what change should be made to gridTr to account for that?,5/4/15,1
DarkManiel,so I don't think the way I set up gridTr and gridTh are correct,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,they_„Žre close for sure,5/4/15,1
DarkManiel,"so, should gridTr be a function that iterates through the array of arrays?",5/4/15,1
lossyrob,it could be,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,"or, you could change `gridTh` into a function",5/4/15,1
lossyrob,that took as an argument the array that represents the row values,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,and then that would be the argument for the map you wrote,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,"so `gridTr` would be something that iterates over the row Array, and feeds those elements (which are arrays) into the `gridTh` function, and handles putting the outputs together between <tr/>s",5/4/15,1
DarkManiel,"Okay, I think I see what you're saying. I'll try to play around with that and see what I can get",5/4/15,1
lossyrob,ok cool,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,here_„Žs a hacked together JS Fiddle you can play around with to scope the example,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,http://jsfiddle.net/nb776mzs/,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,sorry,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,http://jsfiddle.net/nb776mzs/1/,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,"so if you could get the output of that to say 1 - 16 in the right format in the table, you win",5/4/15,1
DarkManiel,"Thanks, by the way, the colNum from scala is a bit strange. I get an array of size 225, but cols = -4095 and rows = 5317. I'm not sure I understand this correctly",5/4/15,1
DarkManiel,are the actual rownum and colnum equal? if so I could always just take the squareroot,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,what do you mean colNum?,5/4/15,1
DarkManiel,number of rows and columngs,5/4/15,1
DarkManiel,columns*,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,not sure why you_„Žre getting negative values,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,for cols,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,"but you should return the number of columns in your value grid. so usually that would be like 16, if it_„Žs a 16 x 16 grid.",5/4/15,1
lossyrob,which is probably always what the endpoint should do. And just return something like Double.NaN for the rest of the values if they fall off the raster,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,like for border pixels,5/4/15,1
DarkManiel,okay... I'll look into that too then,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,@echeipesh have you had a chance to look at the accumulo performance stuff with @notthatbreezy and @moradology? Curious about where that_„Žs at.,5/4/15,1
notthatbreezy,we're testing it out now -- @moradology put together a branch that seems like it will work,5/4/15,1
moradology,"on friday, i talked to @echeipesh and got some guidance about slow accumulo ingest",5/4/15,1
echeipesh,"Yeah, that was performance for an unoptimized batchwriter.  @moradology  PR1076 adds the HDFS ingest that should be much better.",5/4/15,1
moradology,the branch with 'strategies' is where that sits - also uncovered a bug related to keybounds,5/4/15,1
echeipesh,HDFS ingest is what I was benchmarking with to be clear.,5/4/15,1
moradology,"which was just luck to find and, i think, @echeipesh was already on the trail of",5/4/15,1
moradology,"cool, cool",5/4/15,1
lossyrob,ok nice.,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,so the slow ingest that chris was doing was the BatchAccumuloInputFormat ingest? not the write-to-HDFS-and-then-hoover-using-Accumulo-API strategy?,5/4/15,1
echeipesh,correct,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,cool. thanks guys.,5/4/15,1
notthatbreezy,"good news - got an ingest done in about 10 minutes, @echeipesh has a fix in the works for the metadata/layer error in accumulo too so after that's merged in we're looking pretty good",5/4/15,1
lossyrob,woot,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,"10 minutes, what sort of cluster size?",5/4/15,1
notthatbreezy,"10 r3.4xlarges -- 160 cores, 1100 GB of memory",5/4/15,1
lossyrob,"woof, that_„Žs a big cluster",5/4/15,1
notthatbreezy,"yeah, wanted it to fail fast if it was going to fail -- still using spot instances. We're trying out eugene's most recent PR so if we can ingest multiple datasets then we should be good to go",5/4/15,1
lossyrob,did you get to see the utilization stats for that 10 min ingest?,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,and that processing a layer that_„Žs like 70 GB right?,5/4/15,1
notthatbreezy,"yeah, looked pretty good -- I think it wsa about 90 GB (at least that's what was stored in memory once by spark)",5/4/15,1
notthatbreezy,I guess it was more like 17 minutes (looking at how long it took accumulo to ingest the HDFS files),5/4/15,1
notthatbreezy,[![accumulo-ingest-good.png](https://files.gitter.im/geotrellis/geotrellis/fYfO/thumb/accumulo-ingest-good.png)](https://files.gitter.im/geotrellis/geotrellis/fYfO/accumulo-ingest-good.png),5/4/15,1
lossyrob,"ok, so it took 10 minutes to get it into HDFS, 7 min to ingest up into accumulo/",5/4/15,1
lossyrob,?,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,hm that cpu usages is a bit weird yeah?,5/4/15,1
notthatbreezy,"yeah towards the end -- that's accumulo, the spark job was over by then",5/4/15,1
notthatbreezy,I decreased the s3 page size to make sure the number of partitions was at least as big as the cluster,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,so the ingest starts at like 15:24:30?,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,wonder what_„Žs happening at 15:31,5/4/15,1
echeipesh,"looks like a shuffle stage, previous stage dumps to disk and start of next stage sucks up the shuffle files and starts to churn them.",5/4/15,1
notthatbreezy,[![spark.png](https://files.gitter.im/geotrellis/geotrellis/E5nH/thumb/spark.png)](https://files.gitter.im/geotrellis/geotrellis/E5nH/spark.png),5/4/15,1
notthatbreezy,this is from the one I just ran,5/4/15,1
notthatbreezy,so about 13 minutes in spark,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,and about half of that is saving to hdfs. or perhaps that includes some additional processing that doesn_„Žt happen until that action?,5/4/15,1
echeipesh,that looks like +1 on that PR ?,5/4/15,1
notthatbreezy,"I think by that point it's just dumping it -- the RDD has already been materialized and is in cache (hence all the skipped stages), let me see if I can find some disk IO metrics that we can match up too",5/4/15,1
lossyrob,What is going on with travis. ugh.,5/4/15,1
echeipesh,Labor strike looks like.,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,@echeipesh 1076?,5/4/15,1
echeipesh,"1078, but yeah, that one too",5/4/15,1
echeipesh,Chris said he was running code from 1078 on that last ingest,5/4/15,1
notthatbreezy,"yeah, let me do a second ingest here",5/4/15,1
notthatbreezy,the second one was what was failing before,5/4/15,1
notthatbreezy,just started it,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,what_„Žs that caching server that starts with a v?,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,nvm varnish,5/4/15,1
notthatbreezy,yeah,5/4/15,1
echeipesh,merging 1078 since it worked for Chris on the ingest.,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,"Ok, I wanted to reveiw the metadata catalog removal",5/4/15,1
lossyrob,"but I can just do that after the fact, so go for it",5/4/15,1

echeipesh,definitely,5/4/15,1
echeipesh,Want me to take a look at gt-admin ?,5/4/15,1
lossyrob,yeah. the FB students need their PR_„Žs to be merged in by Friday. The gt-admin is pointing to the catalog-refactor branch. so if they update and publish local it_„Žll mess with them,5/4/15,1
echeipesh,"ok, they_„Žd be messed up either way since there is no longer metaDataCatalog value. I_„Žll send a PR to gt-admin.",5/4/15,1
lossyrob,"right, ok. Yeah they_„Žve been updating to that branch, and we haven_„Žt been making it easy on them ha. I guess that_„Žs what happens when you are working off a branch with the name `refactor` in it",5/4/15,1

lossyrob,gdal would do it,5/6/15,1
pomadchin,it saves projection information correct?,5/6/15,1
lossyrob,yup!,5/6/15,1
pomadchin,o:,5/6/15,1
pomadchin,wow,5/6/15,1
lossyrob,there_„Žs some GeoTIFF specific options that you_„Žll want to get used to,5/6/15,1
lossyrob,http://www.gdal.org/frmt_gtiff.html,5/6/15,1
pomadchin,O_O,5/6/15,1
lossyrob,things like `gdal_translate -co compress=deflate -tiled=yes input.hdf out.tif`,5/6/15,1
lossyrob,"gdal is the jam. if you need to do anythign with file conversions, it most probably can do what you need + 100 other things",5/6/15,1
lossyrob,"so for instance, we use GDAL to do a lot of preprocessing of rasters before we ingest it into GeoTrellis, which is specifically good for distributed raster process. but anything as far as, convert this HDF5 to GeoTiff, that_„Žs GDAL",5/6/15,1
lossyrob,"or even using something like `rasterio`, which is a sweet python lib on top of GDAL, to do stuff like, take this netCDF file and tile it into single band GeoTiffs_„_and under the covers that_„Žs all using GDAL functionality",5/6/15,1
pomadchin,o: magic ,5/6/15,1
lossyrob,yeah. GDAL is the giant_„Žs shoulders which all geospatial raster open source code stands on. So thank Frank Warmerdam if you ever get the opportunity.,5/6/15,1
pomadchin,"thought that it would be nice to make all processing inside hdfs (before accumulo ingesting):1. load modis hdf to hdfs. 2. convert to tiff (make a dir insede hdfs) 3. run accumulo ingestit is not possible or it is  a sort of overhead?",5/6/15,1
pomadchin,"now we are making a similar thing: loading hdf files to a host machine, reprojecting via mrt and gdal tools, then ingesting => ....",5/6/15,1
lossyrob,"well, that_„Žs a limitation of GDAL. It_„Žd be nice if we had an HDF reader, then we could read direct from HDFS, but we dont",5/6/15,1
lossyrob,so what we usually do is do the per-file processing of other formats into a GeoTIFF and push it up to HDFS then,5/6/15,1
lossyrob,or s3,5/6/15,1
lossyrob,"and we_„Žre building systems that actually do that in a scalable way when your data starts in s3, where you create a workflow where a set of 100s of nodes pull data down from s3 and do the GDAL processing, throw it back up on s3, ready to be ingested and used in GeoTrellis",5/6/15,1
lossyrob,"so for the HDFS route, if there_„Žs a similar chain where you could do some of the processing of the modis as you load it into HDFS, that would be good. otherwise, we do have a reader that uses GDAL bindings",5/6/15,1
lossyrob,you can find it in the geotrellis.gdal subproject,5/6/15,1
lossyrob,"it_„Žs a little bit thin, so I haven_„Žt/don_„Žt lean on it too hard",5/6/15,1
pomadchin,"yep, saw it",5/6/15,1
pomadchin,hm,5/6/15,1
pomadchin,thx a lot for responses,5/6/15,1
lossyrob,"but you could use that. the trick would be, because GDAL needs the files to be on the local file system, you_„Žd have use an InputFormat that copies to local file system before processing",5/6/15,1
lossyrob,we do have one of those I believe,5/6/15,1
lossyrob,https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/io/hadoop/formats/GdalInputFormat.scala,5/6/15,1

lossyrob,"but that could be another path. we found that actually doing a preprocessing step ended up being easier, when we were working with netCDF files (which are backed by HDF5)",5/6/15,1

kyeah,"It *should* set up its own local/embedded instance, but maybe I'm misunderstanding Datastax's embedded cassandra class/trait?",5/7/15,1
lossyrob,ok,5/7/15,1
lossyrob,"so I just ran `cassandra`, and got some output",5/7/15,1
lossyrob,"then ran the test, and it worked (well, failed, but actually ran)",5/7/15,1
kyeah,"okay, so it needs the cassandra service to be running then",5/7/15,1
lossyrob,"hmmm. ok, that_„Žs not ideal",5/7/15,1
kyeah,yeah there didn't seem to be any library to mock out a cassandra instance,5/7/15,1
lossyrob,ok gotcha. we_„Žll work with it,5/7/15,1
lossyrob,perhaps that_„Žs something that @allixender can start looking into,5/7/15,1
lossyrob,@kyeah can you think of a good way to test for Cassanrda on the system? I don_„Žt want to run the tests if the user doesn_„Žt have cassandra,5/7/15,1
kyeah,"I'm guessing attempting a connection and catching the ""Failed to Start Cassandra"" error is non-ideal?",5/7/15,1
lossyrob,I_„Žm confused about how `EmbeddedCassandra` works with the `SharedEmbeddedCassanrda` object,5/7/15,1
kyeah,The SharedEmbeddedCassandra object does all the work with setting up the test cluster,5/7/15,1
lossyrob,I_„Žm looking at the datastax EmbeddedCassandra and don_„Žt see it doing a lot,5/7/15,1
kyeah,EmbeddedCassandra is only there to recreate the keyspace before every spec is run,5/7/15,1
lossyrob,https://github.com/datastax/spark-cassandra-connector/blob/master/spark-cassandra-connector-embedded/src/main/scala/com/datastax/spark/connector/embedded/EmbeddedCassandra.scala,5/7/15,1
lossyrob,looks like DataStax enterprise has an in-memory version. :angry: ,5/7/15,1
lossyrob,"@kyeah if you do `test:run` to generate new test files, do the unit tests pass for you?",5/7/15,1
lossyrob,I_„Žm getting `java.io.IOException: Failed to open native connection to Cassandra at {192.168.96.102}:9042` for each of the `CassandraRasterCatalogSpec` tests,5/7/15,1
lossyrob,but the `CassandraAttributeStoreSpec` tests pass,5/7/15,1
kyeah,I'm getting RuntimeExceptions instead of the expected LayerNotFound errors,5/7/15,1
kyeah,but yeah otherwise they pass,5/7/15,1
kyeah,argh,5/7/15,1
lossyrob,hmm,5/7/15,1
lossyrob,ok. well I_„Žm going to put it away for a bit. I think we should figure out the Cassanrda test situation before merging it into master,5/7/15,1
kyeah,"yeah, definitely",5/7/15,1
lossyrob,slash get through some of the env config errors.,5/7/15,1
lossyrob,"figured out why the merge into `catalog-refactor` has been such a crazy pain (for those of you who accidently tried to update a catalog-refactor branch to master, you_„Žll know the pain) - I had accidentally merged the catalog-refactor changes into master at some point, and then reverted the changes through github. That has really affected the merge, where the merge sometimes takes changes of the revert over the changes of the commit, since it was a later commit. ",5/7/15,1
lossyrob,"so, know not to ever do that again.",5/7/15,1
lossyrob,and now I know that `git merge -s ours upstream/master` would have saved me many an hour if I thought of it back then,5/7/15,1
hectcastro,I merged the Accumulo branch on the cluster project.,5/7/15,1
lossyrob,woot,5/7/15,1
lossyrob,"also in case anyone didn_„Žt catch it from my late night journaling, I merged `catalog-refactor` into `master`",5/7/15,1
lossyrob,"if you_„Žve been using `master`, and update, the changes will be breaking since there are API updates. Please let us know if you run into troubles and we_„Žll work them out together",5/7/15,1
pomadchin,so master branch compiles?,5/7/15,1
lossyrob,I hope so! you can always rely on that being the case,5/7/15,1
lossyrob,sometimes the Travis build says it fails. but also sometimes Travis is a liar :),5/7/15,1
lossyrob,"but nothing goes into master that breaks the build, that_„Žs the rule anyway",5/7/15,1
lossyrob,we set the bar pretty high: _„ñmaster should compile_„ :shipit: ,5/7/15,1
alimavrakis,"Working in gt-admin in ubuntu, using vagrant to run the server, would I need to port forward 2181 to talk with zookeeper?",5/7/15,1
alimavrakis,I'm running into issues where vagrant is starting zookeeper but ingest will say zookeeper isn't running. Not positive as to whether than interaction is direct or indirect.,5/7/15,1
lossyrob,have you stared zookeeper with `zkServer start`?,5/7/15,1
alimavrakis,Inside the vbox? ,5/7/15,1
alimavrakis,I believe the provisioner starts it,5/7/15,1
alimavrakis,I may be wrong ,5/7/15,1
lossyrob,it should. but perhaps it fell off for some reason? something to try,5/7/15,1
alimavrakis,okay cool i'll look at it,5/7/15,1
alimavrakis,I'm having nfs issues so that may also be part of it...,5/7/15,1
pomadchin,"hm, i see accumulo version upgrade task #1088 o: all versions would be (tried to be) supported? what version would be primary?",5/7/15,1
lossyrob,"we_„Žre moving support to 1.6, so we would require that users use 1.6 (which is the most up to date version)",5/7/15,1
alimavrakis,Turns out it was running,5/7/15,1
alimavrakis,the ports needed to be forwarded,5/7/15,1
alimavrakis,I updated my vagrant file and it's connecting now,5/7/15,1
notthatbreezy,oh great -- did you figure out the NFS issues too?,5/7/15,1
alimavrakis,"I have it syncing now. I'm not even entirely sure if there was an issue though.  It wouldn't mount, but then after it did, it didn't actaully show up. So I did a bunch of debugging--turns out I hadn't noticed the mount dir had been moved in the Vagrant file from old versions of the repo",5/7/15,1
alimavrakis,no longer mounting in ~/Vagrant. Now it mounts in /Vagrant.,5/7/15,1
alimavrakis,"Now when I ingest, it can't find gis on zookeper. I'm in the middle of running build-all right now, but I don't know if that could be the problem-- if anyone has a clue I wouldn't mind :)",5/7/15,1
alimavrakis,fixed.,5/7/15,1
josephwinston,Two questions:,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,@josephwinston shoot!,5/8/15,1
josephwinston,"Well -- It seems something happened, Trying again:1. I wasn't able to find out if there are any concerns on using GeoTrellis with specific spark versions.  Is there a document that describes what will and will not work?  2. I data normally viewed as a raster that has more than 2 dimensions.  An example of this is seen in the GeoTrellis web site is the Weighted Overlay Demo.  I want to quickly bring up a proof of concept with my data.  Is the Web Service Demo would be the best place to start?",5/8/15,1
lossyrob,Currently the master branch works with Spark 1.2.0. I also think we_„Žve been working with Spark 1.3.0 as well,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,"I_„Žve also run it with 1.1.1, however that was a bit ago. So I don_„Žt know exactly which work and which have API breaks, but I haven_„Žt hit up against any yet from 1.1.1 on",5/8/15,1
lossyrob,"As for 2, how do you mean by having more than 2 dimensions? Do you mean having different raster layers over the same area?",5/8/15,1
lossyrob,A good place to start might be our chattanooga demo: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis-chatta-demo,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,you can see a running example of that here: http://demo.geotrellis.com/chatta/,5/8/15,1
josephwinston,"@lossyrob  -- Thanks for the details.  On my development system, I'm using trunk so that I can have access to some of the 1.4 features as soon as possible bit I certainly can use 1.3.x to see how well this works with my data.The extra dimension in this specific case is depth.  So, raster slices can be made ""parallel"" a normal GIS map.",5/8/15,1
lossyrob,"I would be curious to see how it worked with 1.4, I don_„Žt think anything *should* break, but it would take someone trying to figure it out",5/8/15,1
lossyrob,"and also, the spark work exists in the not-yet-released 0.10, so would have to pull from master.",5/8/15,1
lossyrob,"The chatta demo works with GeoTrellis 0.9, which doesn_„Žt use Spark, but uses an Akka actor system that parallelizes operation execution over tiles.",5/8/15,1
lossyrob,"We_„Žre currently pushing forward on the 0.10 release, and hope to have it out this month.",5/8/15,1
josephwinston,@lossyrob -- I don't have a problem using an older version of GeoTrellis if you feel that it would give me an idea of the performance of the system.  I need display a small amount of geo-referenced rasters from large data sets.,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,how large?,5/8/15,1
josephwinston,"For proof of concept, less than 30 gigabytes.",5/8/15,1
lossyrob,That about gets to the limit of where I_„Žd say you should be using the 0.10 stuff and Spark.,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,Unfortunately it_„Žs still being built so documentation is rare. Though we_„Žre very willing to talk through how to set up examples,5/8/15,1
josephwinston,Ok.  I'll start on GeoTrellis head then.,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,what are you trying to run this on? Do you have any cluster capabilities? Something set up with HDFS?,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,"Accumulo is what we use to get the most speed out of computations, because it acts as an index on top of HDFS that we can control how to store the tiles.",5/8/15,1
josephwinston,I can run on a cluster or a single machine with enough physical RAM to hold the entire 30 GB data set.,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,But we also can read directly from S3 if you_„Žre working on EC2 and don_„Žt mind paying the cost of pulling data off S3,5/8/15,1
josephwinston,I'll be happy to use Accumulo too,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,"Ok, great. A good proof of concept could be devised with a hefty machine running HDFS/Accumulo/Spark locally",5/8/15,1
lossyrob,"First step would be to setup HDFS, ZooKeeper and Accumulo",5/8/15,1
lossyrob,next would be to ingest your data,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,what format is it in? GeoTIFF would be easiest,5/8/15,1
josephwinston,"I've done everything there before except Accumulo and the only real work is converting the data into GeoTiff, which I believe I can do in Python using GDAL.",5/8/15,1
lossyrob,surely. What_„Žs the resolution?,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,per raster. is it tiled already or stored in pretty large files?,5/8/15,1
josephwinston,I've got Python code to read the large file and spit out numpy arrays.,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,"great. if you could take 512x512 or 1024x1024  chunks and spit out GeoTiffs into a directory, that would be prime for ingest",5/8/15,1
lossyrob,you could put those into local filesystem or HDFS if you_„Žd like,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,"you_„Žd want to separate them out into directories per layer that you_„Žll want to ingest. Each layer is a single-band raster layer. The ingest will ingest it at the TMS zoom level that most closely matches the native resolution, and if you want (per an option) it will pyramid up the zoom levels",5/8/15,1
josephwinston,The resolution can easily be interpolated to be whatever is needed. It is pretty coarse in the x-y plane.,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,"there_„Žs some logic in the ingest to get close, and resample based on the tiling scheme",5/8/15,1
josephwinston,Understand about the zoom.  That's why I want to try it out to see what the performance looks like.,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,"once you ingest, you_„Žll have a set of tiles per layer, with each tile being 512x512 or 256x256 for the zoom level, and indexed according to a Space Filling Curve. From then on it_„Žs pretty easy to work with the layer.",5/8/15,1
lossyrob,what sort of output are you looking for?,5/8/15,1
josephwinston,Any magic behind building GeoTrillis head that I need to know?,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,just have `SPARK_HOME` defined in the env,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,"other then that, `./sbt ""project spark_„ assembly` should give you a fat jar of all the spark work",5/8/15,1
lossyrob,that jar is what you_„Žll call the ingest on through `spark-submit`,5/8/15,1
josephwinston,Good to know.  What is the right way to use HDFS/Accumolo stack?  Is it building the table (image) in Accumulo?  I don't see how that would be correct since the result isn't a GeoTiff.,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,sorry not sure what you mean_„_building which table?,5/8/15,1
josephwinston,"I've never used Accmulo so I don't know what I need to do.  Hopefully, the task is nothing more than placing the GeoTiffs in the right HDFS directory.",5/8/15,1
lossyrob,"So, you_„Žd place the GeoTiffs into HDFS",5/8/15,1
josephwinston,Much easier.  I like that ;-),5/8/15,1
lossyrob,then you_„Žd use `spark-submit` to run an `AccumuloIngestCommand` with some parameters (a script to do so can be found here https://gist.github.com/lossyrob/fda457994a4be6db598c),5/8/15,1
lossyrob,"That runs the ingest process, which takes the GeoTiff, does the appropriate reprojecting, tiling, indexing, and saving of the data into accumulo",5/8/15,1
lossyrob,"Accumulo stores the indexed tiles in an Accumulo table, along with metadata",5/8/15,1
josephwinston,Ok.  I thought that I needed to make the indexed tiles directly.  Your approach is so much better than mine.,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,"then in code, to start working with that layer as a `RasterRDD`, you_„Žll use an `AccumuloRasterCatalog` to retreive that layer by it_„Žs LayerId",5/8/15,1
lossyrob,nope the GeoTrellis code takes care of the (pretty complicated) task of indexing the tiles,5/8/15,1
josephwinston,Any rules of thumb on the number of spark workers?,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,"As many as cores that you have is a rule of thumb, but if you find that you_„Žre IO bound and not pegging CPUs while processing, you can push that number up",5/8/15,1
josephwinston,@lossyrob -- Thank you very much for your help.  It is time for me to build code and see what I can do before I ask another question.,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,"great! no problem, looking forward to hearing the next batch :)",5/8/15,1
pomadchin,"@lossyrob again, about ingesting tiles without pyramid: just ingested tiles, without pyramid, nothing got here `catalog.metaDataCatalog.fetchAll`mb I understand it (ingesting without pyramid) incorrect?",5/8/15,1
lossyrob,"@pomadchin there was bug in an older version of the codebase that made it so when you didn_„Žt pyramid it didn_„Žt actually save. That bug is fixed. If you update to master, that should be solved. Also the API has changed, so you_„Žll have to update your code to the new catalog API",5/8/15,1
echeipesh,Merging in Accumulo 1.6 change. The clustter repo already supports it. This is the official switch to 1.6.2 as the supported version.,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,"cool, thanks for the heads up",5/8/15,1
pomadchin,"yep, updating now; api changed a lot ._.' Took me time to fix my code",5/8/15,1
lossyrob,@echeipesh does this mean I_„Žll have to upgrade my Accumulo? Do we have a path for that?,5/8/15,1
echeipesh,Oh your machine ?,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,yeah,5/8/15,1
echeipesh,"Yeah, it_„Žs actually super simple. I was able to download the 1.6 tarbal, copy config from 1.5 and launch without issues.",5/8/15,1
pomadchin,"accumulo 1.6.2 would be in master soon, or waiting for next pack of updates?",5/8/15,1
echeipesh,You just need to make sure you change your $ACCUMULO_HOME and you_„Žre gtg.,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,ok. so nothing to migrate the data,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,?,5/8/15,1
echeipesh,Nope,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,cool,5/8/15,1
pomadchin,:0,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,"@pomadchin Accumulo 1.6 was just merged into master, so if you update to master you_„Žll have to use 1.6",5/8/15,1
echeipesh,I don_„Žt see anything about changes to the record structure in the release notes either.,5/8/15,1
pomadchin,"Yep, cool",5/8/15,1
echeipesh,geotrellis-ec2-cluster was upgraded yesterday with accumulo 1.6.2 support. So it should be a smooth transition.,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,we need to get `vagrant.geotrellis` up to date,5/8/15,1
echeipesh,What was the reasoning to keep that sepratate from the vagrant stuff on `geotrellic-ec2-cluster`?,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,nice. Only down to 2 PR_„Žs open. that_„Žs a breath of fresh air,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,for having a single VM development environment,5/8/15,1
echeipesh,"ah, right",5/8/15,1
lossyrob,"if we_„Žre using `geotrellis-ec2-cluster` for a dev environment just to run geotrellis, then that name might be too ec2 centric",5/8/15,1
echeipesh,We really need to make a geotrellis-spark demo project that has small enough dataset to work on that machine.,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,but I_„Žve always had problems with running the multiple VMs,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,yeah. that would be a good thing to have for the release,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,publishing local is being real tricky with master for me and a facebook open academy student. anyone else have that issue?,5/8/15,1
echeipesh,@moradology had issues yestorday. He ended up having to blow away target directory in geotrellis project and .ivy2/local to fix it.,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,fun w/ the simple build tool,5/8/15,1
echeipesh,I thought it stood for Solid Build Tool ?,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,it_„Žs actually staccato build tool,5/8/15,1
echeipesh,"ah, that makes sense why they have the flamenco dancer in their logo",5/8/15,1

lossyrob,@echeipesh what did `val zooms = catalog.metaDataCatalog.zoomLevelsFor(layer)` turn into again?,5/8/15,1
echeipesh,That didn_„Žt turn into anything. You could make a function that gives you from `readAll[LayerMetaData]`. Do you think that belongs in the attributeStore ?,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,not sure,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,we should probably have some functionality on the RasterCatalog to deal with metadata,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,I_„Žm writing stuff in the gt-admin that doesn_„Žt feel like client code,5/8/15,1
echeipesh,Ok. I was wondering if we were going to be able to avoid that.,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,having this in client code feels weird,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,"```  val metaDatas = attributeStore.readAll[AccumuloLayerMetaData](""metadata_„)  def zoomLevelsFor(layer: String) =    metaDatas.keys.filter(_._1.name == layerName).map(_._1.zoom).toSeq```",5/8/15,1
ZachSand,@lossyrob /offtopic/ Sorry I couldn't make it to the meeting this morning. Let me know if there are any outstanding questions you have for me. I'm available to respond on here/Kato/email,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,ok thanks Zach,5/8/15,1
echeipesh,"yeah, `(_._1.name == layerName)` kills it",5/8/15,1
echeipesh,I had a thought a while ago that we could use zoom level 0 as a special place to keep attributes that apply across all layers.,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,"Another thing, `  def readTile[K: TileReader: JsonFormat: ClassTag](layerId: LayerId): Reader[K, Tile] =` in AccumuloRasterCatalog seems like a misnomer. returns a reader",5/8/15,1

ZachSand,@lossyrob Are there any tasks you need/want done for gt-admin? I was thinking about making a top navbar like the one in the admin project but wasn't sure if there were any more pertinent things to work on. ,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,"@ZachSand no.  I need to get your PR merged in today, and then that should wrap up the course",5/8/15,1

lossyrob,"that_„Žs always, of course, welcome :)",5/8/15,1
lossyrob,"for now we_„Žll be working on getting everything merged into gt-admin and see where it_„Žs at. I think after things get sured up to where they are now a little bit, we_„Žll know where we want to take it next, what UI features we want to add, etc",5/8/15,1

lossyrob,did the upgrade go well for you,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,?,5/8/15,1
pomadchin,"yep, everything seems to be ok; but new geotrellis api is not very obvious ",5/8/15,1
lossyrob,we_„Žd appreciate feedback on the new API,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,"so if there_„Žs anything you find that_„Žs wonky, let us know!",5/8/15,1
lossyrob,"The idea is that a catalog provides readers and writers, and those are the objects taht actually do reading and writing of RasterRDD_„Žs and Tiles",5/8/15,1
lossyrob,"That architecture makes it easier to be consistent across the different backends we now support: Hadoop, Accumuo, S3, and soon Cassanrda",5/8/15,1
pomadchin,Hm I noticed some generic approach,5/8/15,1
pomadchin,"but there were different useful function to get useful metadata like layer zooming, etc",5/8/15,1
pomadchin,functions**,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,"yes, that_„Žs now missing. We have to work on that API",5/8/15,1
lossyrob,I ran into that as well,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,"some thoughts around that, we had a MetaDataCatalog concept and an AttributeStore concept",5/8/15,1
lossyrob,"and it seemed like MetaData was just a particular Attribute, so we merged it into AttributeStore",5/8/15,1
lossyrob,though there are some things missing now. We_„Žll have to review that,5/8/15,1
pomadchin,"heh, noticed your code In a gt admin, very useful, but it was too late, Guessed how to refactor before ",5/8/15,1
pomadchin,"btw, seems to me there is some semantics issues, like `readTile`",5/8/15,1

lossyrob,`catalog.tileReader[SpatialKey](layerId).read(key)`,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,Perhaps there_„Žll be some delegation,5/8/15,1
lossyrob,"to make it simpler, but that is what is accurate with the architecture",5/8/15,1
pomadchin,"in conclusion it seems to me new api is better, but little harder (mb seems harder)anyway it was possible for me to refactor old code without sorts of _migration guides_, but not very quicknice work :)",5/8/15,1

allixender,"it is also odd that the file lists filter in HdfsUtils would only filter on `ne*.tif` files, not sure where this actually originates. Maybe this was only  added by @kyeah in the feature/cassandra branch?",5/19/15,1
mfsny,"@lossyrob so I was able to draw a PNG based on the description you provided (with a small addition required due to the fact, that kernelDensity returns a Tile and renderPng does not work with Tiles, so I had to create a RasterSource based on Tile and Extent and then I could use renderPng on this rasterSource). Thanks again. Now my colleague gave me  a different shape file which contains MultiPolygons. I can read it, no problems there. But what I do not really understand is how to use rasterize on multiPolygons. The first parameter is Geometry and I do not really get it how to convert from multiPolygons to Geometry. Sorry but thanks to my poor knowledge of scala and almost no documentation , especially for 0.10, I am forced to use this channel to get any further in evaluation of geotrellis for our project.",5/19/15,1

lossyrob,That method gets implicitly added when you `import geotrellis.raster.render._`,5/19/15,1
lossyrob,Depends on what you want to do with the multipolygons?,5/19/15,1
lossyrob,"If you want to run a _„ñkernel density_„ i.e. a convolution on the multipolygons, then you can do that, but it_„Žs trickier and there_„Žs no nice single function call to do it",5/19/15,1
lossyrob,if you let me know what you_„Žre trying to do I_„Žll try to help.,5/19/15,1

Otherwise, we plan on focusing on documentation, and perhaps we should be doing a better job of it as we go, but just getting the features coded enough to get 0.10 release-ready is a feat for the couple of people we have dedicated to this project.

mfsny,"Regarding MultiPolygons, I have a shapefile with many MultiPolygons and want to use spray to display these over the map, very much like you did with raster data in Chattanooga demo. I am using ``VectorToRaster.rasterize(multiPolygons(0).geom,rasterExtent,10)`` but it works for one Polygon only. As you said, I must write my own code, there is no single API call for that at the moment. But thanks for the hint anyways.",5/19/15,1
mfsny,"What we are trying to figure out is the feasibility of the following architecture with Geotrellis: * ingest GeoTIFF files into Hadoop (hdfs at the moment, in future we should consider Accumulo I guess). * spray as webserver can access the ingested geodata in HDFS and serve different HTTP requests, e.g. draw the raster/vector in a map * optionally, some calculation is done by spark on ingested geodata and the results are used by spray to serve the requests.",5/19/15,1

mfsny,"@lossyrob thanks for opening an issue for this. I was not sure if this is really an issue or if I was doing something wrong. As you might have noticed, I am fairly new to the topic and currently in the process of ""learning by doing"", more or less. You asked for the geojson. All I've got is the ARG file with the JSON for both EPSG 27700 and 3857. And I have the same files in GeoTIFF format as well. Which format and which EPSG do you need? Though I can't guarantee that I can provide the files. I#m not sure if there isn't any license on them. Would need to clarify with my colleagues.",5/22/15,1
lossyrob,"No it seems like a legitimate issue, and unfortunately with proj4j.",5/22/15,1
lossyrob,"The GeoJSON I asked for was for the footprint you were reprojecting, but you had given me the Extents, so I have all I need",5/22/15,1
mfsny,"Cool. Why do you mean ""unfortunately"" ?",5/22/15,1
lossyrob,because it_„Žs harder to fix if it_„Žs not a GeoTrellis bug,5/22/15,1
lossyrob,"I understand a lot about proj4j, but it seems like a very specific bug if it_„Žs doing an uncommon projection incorrectly. So to fix it it will probably take reading through the java code a lot",5/22/15,1
mfsny,"well, it is just a coincidence, that the sample data for our evaluation of Geotrellis is in the British EPSG. so no high priority from our point of view.",5/22/15,1

jamesmcclain,"Hello, may I ask a question about setting up geotrellis?  I have cloned the code found here https://github.com/geotrellis/vagrant.geotrellis, setup the VM, and been able to successfully run `buildall.sh` in in the `/vagrant/geotrellis` directory.  My goal is to just get a ""hello world"" geotrellis app going, maybe similar to the one found here https://github.com/jamesmcclain/geotrellis.  What is my next step?",5/26/15,1

But as compared to vim, I found working on Scala IDE faster (due to autofills and type popups for variables). Could someone give some pointers on how to make the project work with Scala IDE?

allixender,"Hey folks, @jamesmcclain @vishalanand I am compiling my experiences with Eclipse and IDEA here https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/issues/1100 , skip the upper part of the Sphinx docs and scroll further down. Basically with Eclipse you would add the `sbt-eclipse` plugin and generate the project files with `./sbt eclipse`, it will understand that there are in fact many sub projects/modules. Some of those project inter-dependencies won't be resolved properly. Haven't worked out why, but found a work around. For IDEA it seems in the newest versions it is in fact discouraged to use the `sbt-idea` plugin, but to import natively via IDEA. Both sort of works. I'd like to write up on that a bit more in-depth for the docs, so please feel free to comment on the issue :+1:  ",5/27/15,1

allixender,"Good stuff! Just running testing import with IntelliJ IDEA, apparently really works just out of the box really. Setting up Eclipse with GeoTrellis was a bit more tricky.

echeipesh,@jamesmcclain It sounds like you may need to test out a geotrellis spark application soon. I tried to use `vagrant.geotrellis` run one of the ingest commands and ran into some issues. I_„Žve made a PR: https://github.com/geotrellis/vagrant.geotrellis/pull/10 that will be helpful if you_„Žre looking at this today.,5/27/15,1
pomadchin,"@echeipesh have you tried to run some custom jobs, to get tiles out of Accumulo (read), on this vm?(just an example)",5/27/15,1
echeipesh,"no not yet, but that_„Žs a good thing to try next. ",5/27/15,1
pomadchin,"just have no time now ): mb only next week I can return to the geotrellis research ): now we have to use old api in prod (before catalog refactor pr); btw don't you know, the old ingest is compatible with the new api? (I mean the old space time ingest to read via new api)",5/27/15,1
lossyrob,nope the value we stored changed :/,5/27/15,1
echeipesh,the metadata too actually,5/27/15,1
lossyrob,"sorry this is changing so fast_„_and is going to change again. @echeipesh developed a better filter API so some code will have to be updated.

pomadchin,Just enough would be to test write and read on a real (single node) cluster :D,5/27/15,1

jamesmcclain,"Thank you for your answers to my previous questions, those were very helpful.  I have another question: for model my watershed, the initial problem that we need to solve with geotrellis is to essentially take population counts inside of polygons.",5/27/15,1
jamesmcclain,"In other words, we have some discrete raster data, and we would like to know the number of occurrences of each type in a query polygon.  It looks like that can be done by masking or clipping the area of interest against the tile set then doing a histogram over what is left.",5/27/15,1
jamesmcclain,Does that sound like a reasonable/efficient method for geotrellis?,5/27/15,1
echeipesh,That sounds like exactly the way to do it.,5/27/15,1
jamesmcclain,"Okay, cool.  What is the recommended way to do this clipping.  Essentially I want to take one or more polygons and clip them against the tile set for the entire US.",5/27/15,1
jamesmcclain,I guess what I am asking is: is there an easy way to restrict attention to some bounding box (say the bounding box of the query polygon)?  Or do I as a user even need to worry about that?,5/27/15,1
notthatbreezy,I think there is kind of an example of that here: https://github.com/geotrellis/benchmark/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/cmd/Benchmark.scala,5/27/15,1
notthatbreezy,Some of the benchmarks are assessing how quickly relevant tiles can be pulled out of accumulo,5/27/15,1

pomadchin,kk,6/1/15,1
pomadchin,"can you have a look at this tile (dropbox link), what about histogram ?",6/1/15,1
pomadchin,seems it is not creating it ._.,6/1/15,1
pomadchin,":D not critical at all, dont need it for these sort of tiles",6/1/15,1
lossyrob,you have to write that manually I believe. so if your ingest isn_„Žt writing it that_„Žs the problem,6/1/15,1
lossyrob,"this is where gt-admin needs some work, hasn_„Žt been fully updated. though I think I did update one of the ingetss",6/1/15,1
lossyrob,hmm I cant_„Ž find it,6/1/15,1
lossyrob,but in ingest,6/1/15,1
lossyrob,you_„Žll have to save off the histogram,6/1/15,1
lossyrob,"which is specific to gt-admin, because it later tries to pull it out for it_„Žs purpose_„_we don_„Žt necessarily want to store the histogram for every application, and there_„Žs  a cost to computing it on save, so that_„Žs pushed to the client",6/1/15,1
lossyrob,it_„Žs a matter of doing something like https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/io/accumulo/AccumuloRasterCatalog.scala#L72,6/1/15,1
pomadchin,"wow, nice",6/1/15,1
lossyrob,"```scalaval histogram = rdd.histogramattributeStore.write(layerId, _„ñhistogram"", histogram)```",6/1/15,1
pomadchin,friendly thing,6/1/15,1
lossyrob,and now that histogram will be available to anyone trying to read the _„ñhistogram_„ out of that layer Id,6/1/15,1
lossyrob,"they will have to know the type, and read it like how it_„Žs being read here https://github.com/geotrellis/gt-admin/blob/master/server/src/main/scala/geotrellis/admin/server/CatalogService.scala#L149",6/1/15,1
lossyrob,in fact you can store anything that is JSON serializable in the attributeStore,6/1/15,1
lossyrob,"so if you had something you wanted to pre-compute, and store along with the layer, you can give it a unique string name and then do an ```attributeStore.write(layerId, _„ñmything_„, mything)```",6/1/15,1
pomadchin,o: super,6/1/15,1
pomadchin,"A theoretical question: can be zcurve and hilbert indexes used for the same aim ? what exactly means spatialResolution and temporalResolution?",6/1/15,1
lossyrob,"Zcurve and hilbert curves are two instances of space filling curves. Space filling curves are what we use to map chunks of N-dimensional space into a 1 dimensional index. They are _„ñinterchangeable_„, with the interchange affecting performance only (assuming that it all works right ;))",6/1/15,1
lossyrob,"Our hilbert implementation is based on the `uzaygezen` library, which is used by other projects and well tested. However, our implementation of it is the least tested, but it_„Žs something that I_„Žm excited to use.",6/1/15,1
lossyrob,"So what is resolution, and how does it play into space filling curves? Let me see how to talk about it...",6/1/15,1
lossyrob,Let me use this image to help,6/1/15,1
lossyrob,![curve](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2320142/6543539/449db6e2-c4ed-11e4-865a-584e056b5469.png),6/1/15,1
lossyrob,"ok. So space `S` is the space we start with_„_so for `SpatialKey` rasters, it_„Žs 2D and so would be a square, but for `SpaceTimeKey` rasters is 3D, and so would look like the cube we see above",6/1/15,1
lossyrob,"In order to index the space using a space filling curve, we first need to partition the space into chunks_„_we are basically creating a grid of points that fill the space, and drawing lines that connect those points",6/1/15,1
lossyrob,"so we cut up the space evenly, and that is what `P(S)` is",6/1/15,1
lossyrob,"if we take the center point of each of those chunks, we get the points in `G`",6/1/15,1
lossyrob,"if we draw a Z curve to connect those points, we get `C(G)`",6/1/15,1
lossyrob,which is a 1 dimensional index,6/1/15,1
lossyrob,"great, so where does the resolution play into it? Well, when we make `P(S)`, that is, cut up the original space into chunks, we can either cut them up into large chunks or small chunks",6/1/15,1
lossyrob,the number of chunks is the resolution,6/1/15,1
lossyrob,sort of,6/1/15,1
lossyrob,because a requirement of SFCs is that the number of partitions in a dimension is `2^k` for some `k`,6/1/15,1
lossyrob,"In our Z curve, we have the added restriction that `k` is the same for each dimension",6/1/15,1
lossyrob,"so if we have 3 dimensions, our `P(S)` is going to be cut up into `2^k * 2^k * 2^k` chunks",6/1/15,1
lossyrob,"in Hilbert, we actually don_„Žt have that restriction.",6/1/15,1
lossyrob,We impose the restiction that the spatial resolution is the same. This fits with TMS resolutions,6/1/15,1
lossyrob,which have cols and rows be `2^k` and `2^k` for some zoom level `k`,6/1/15,1
lossyrob,but the temporal resolution doesn_„Žt have to be the same,6/1/15,1
lossyrob,"so for zoom level 8, but for a lot of time, we can have the number of cols and rows of our grid be `2^8`, but we might want our time to be chunked into `2^15` parts",6/1/15,1
lossyrob,"in which case, `spatialResolution = 8` and `temporalResolution = 15`",6/1/15,1
lossyrob,does that make sense?,6/1/15,1
pomadchin,O: everything is clear,6/1/15,1
lossyrob,awesome,6/1/15,1
pomadchin,"yep, you may have lectures on a coursera or smth like o_o ",6/1/15,1

vishalanand,"I had a query regarding raster input for interpolation. In Kriging, can the raster input consist of the same geometrical coordinates with different associated values? (When I visualize it, this seems improbable; viz. the porosity of a coordinate can not take two different values in a given raster). I happened to come across some `non-Bucketed Semivariogram tests` comprising of such raster inputs (with multiple values for the same point). I was wondering if I should throw an error in such instances, or should I take the average of such raster points (considering multiple readings for porosity measured for the same coordinate)?",6/2/15,1
lossyrob,@vishalanand good question,6/2/15,1
lossyrob,we could do something like take the average of overlapping points,6/2/15,1
lossyrob,but that seems weird,6/2/15,1
lossyrob,"really the user should pass in distinct points, and preprocess them in any way that they want to get it to that point (no pun intended)",6/2/15,1
lossyrob,"are you talking about points that are the same space, or points that map to the same raste cells?",6/2/15,1
lossyrob,i.e.,6/2/15,1
pomadchin,"@lossyrob @vishalanand it is possible mb to define behavior via some function (pass it as an argument), if we need to define behavior to merge points ",6/2/15,1
lossyrob,"```scalaval twoPointsOverlapping =   Seq(PointFeature(1.0, 2.0, 5), PointFeature(1.0, 2.0, 7))val twoPointsSameRasterCell = {  val p1 = PointFeature(1.0, 2.0, 5)  val p2 = PointFeature(1.1, 2.0, 7)  // not the same point, but_„_  val rasterExtent: RasterExtent = ??? // The target raster extent  val (col1, row1) = rasterExtent.mapToGrid(p1.x, p1.y)  val (col2, row2) = rasterExtent.mapToGrod(p2.x, p2.y)  if( col1 == col2 && row1 == row2) {    // These two different points have mapped to the same raster cell.    // What to do here?  }}```",6/2/15,1
lossyrob,"@pomadchin that might work, esp in the case of needing to merge points that take up the same raster cell (because the client code would have to do that computation of mapping to raster cells beforehand to deduplicate, which is non-trivial)",6/2/15,1
vishalanand,"@lossyrob I was talking about points that map to the same raster cells.In case the input corresponds to the one in [here](https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/vector-test/src/test/scala/spec/geotrellis/vector/SemivariogramSpec.scala#L105)```val points = Seq[PointFeature[Int]](        PointFeature(Point(0.0,0.0),10),        PointFeature(Point(0.0,0.0),16),        PointFeature(Point(1.0,0.0),20),        PointFeature(Point(0.0,1.0),24),        PointFeature(Point(2.0,2.0),50)        )```@pomadchin In case of merging, I think that could be done.",6/2/15,1
lossyrob,"it looks like that_„Žs the case of duplicate points ( [0.0, 0.0] )",6/2/15,1
vishalanand,"@lossyrob  Oh, yes! Sorry, I was speaking of points that are in the same space (and not points pointing to the same raster space).(I had assumed before that same raster space refers to the same PointFeatures with the exact feature value as well, in your previous comment).",6/2/15,1
lossyrob,"Points are in a (Double, Double) space, often I_„Žll use the term _„ñMap Space_„, since they are coordinates in the space of the projection (like lat long, web mercator)",6/2/15,1
lossyrob,"raster space is grid cols/rows, (Int, Int), like col = 5 row = 3",6/2/15,1
lossyrob,"also I_„Žll call that _„ñGrid Space""",6/2/15,1
pomadchin,"/offtop/ this mapToGrid function is the most amazing thing: find (r,c) of a certain pixel o: awesome",6/2/15,1
lossyrob,:) yup it does all the math from converting to/from Map and Grid spaces,6/2/15,1
pomadchin,"@lossyrob thought a little about geotiff reader commit: mb to hink how to get rid of arity and types in some functions? smth like:```def combine[T](b: T*)(f: (T*) => T)(implicit num: Numeric[T]): T = f(b: _*)combine(1, 2, 3)({case Seq(a, b, c) => a + b + c})```",6/2/15,1
lossyrob,those will box and be slow,6/2/15,1
pomadchin,and to generate with macors?,6/2/15,1
pomadchin,"similar to `shapeless` `HMap` constructor, and other shapeless functions",6/2/15,1
lossyrob,not sure how to generate the seq call with macros_„_but I am doing something similar with the `def combine(f: Array[Int] => Int)`,6/2/15,1
pomadchin,o: wow noticed,6/2/15,1
lossyrob,"If we want to do something like that, we could",6/2/15,1
lossyrob,"like, have a varargs of the bands",6/2/15,1
lossyrob,but it would end up being like the Array function,6/2/15,1
pomadchin,"yep, really",6/2/15,1
lossyrob,`def combine(b: Int*)(f: Array[Int] => Int): Tile`,6/2/15,1

pomadchin,:D,6/2/15,1
lossyrob,do you think that would be useful?,6/2/15,1
lossyrob,I can add that for sure,6/2/15,1
lossyrob,if so can you comment on the PR on `MuliBandTile.scala` as such? I_„Žm keeping my TODO list there :),6/2/15,1
pomadchin,":D not critical I think, just 'generic' thoughts; really need only three arity function",6/2/15,1
lossyrob,"it has up to 4, or you can use the Array one to get all of them.",6/2/15,1
lossyrob,"might be useful in case someone wants to use 5 bands out of an 11 band raster, say. that way not all 11 values need to be read",6/2/15,1
pomadchin,hm,6/2/15,1
pomadchin,some modis rasters have more then 11 bands,6/2/15,1
pomadchin,but actually don't need them all,6/2/15,1
lossyrob,would you need more than 4 bands for an operation?,6/2/15,1
lossyrob,also I want to write an operation on MultiBandTile which drops it to a subset of bands,6/2/15,1
lossyrob,"like `multiBandTile.bands(1, 3, 5)` would produce a 3 band tile out of X > 5 bands",6/2/15,1
lossyrob,so you can do things like drop the alpha band if you don_„Žt want it,6/2/15,1
pomadchin,"hm, mb it would be useful to specify what bands to ingest of multiband tiles, ot it is too heavy operation?",6/2/15,1
lossyrob,yeah that does make sense. and will be part of the MulitBand spark work_„_still trying to nail the geotrellis.raster.MultiBand single threaded stuff,6/2/15,1
lossyrob,"but right, it oculd use that `multiBandTiles.bands(1,2,3)` function inside of the ingest, to specify what bands we want to carry over",6/2/15,1
lossyrob,@pomadchin do you have any experience with working with Byte type rasters that have NoData values?,6/2/15,1
pomadchin,"@lossyrob dont remember about `Byte`, but really had some problems with `NoData` values with landsat rasters",6/2/15,1
lossyrob,there_„Žs weirdness around the fact that java doesn_„Žt support unsigned types. serious weirdness,6/2/15,1
pomadchin,"): was really long ago, mb next week will be working with it again, there was a problem, that we needed to change raster type / to change some pixels values to load tiles without overlapping some areas, mb you remember it",6/2/15,1
lossyrob,that I_„Žm going to have to code a lot to get around,6/2/15,1
lossyrob,hmmm_„_.I_„Žm having trouble remembering that,6/2/15,1
pomadchin,got `UInt16` `NoData` troubles,6/2/15,1
pomadchin,`isNoData(-2147483648) //> true`,6/2/15,1
pomadchin,so it is `-2^31`,6/2/15,1
pomadchin,"and as a variant workaround was to make snth like `gdal_calc.py -A LC81770282014081LGN00_B4.tif --outfile=result.tif --calc=""(A>0)*A + (A==0)*(-2147483648)""`",6/2/15,1
lossyrob,yup_„_.same problems as Byte,6/2/15,1
lossyrob,well that looks like Int.MinValue,6/2/15,1
lossyrob,-2147483648,6/2/15,1
pomadchin,yes,6/2/15,1
lossyrob,"not Short.MinValue, which is the NoData of Short, so not exactly the same problem",6/2/15,1
lossyrob,"perhaps though, if it_„Žs being read in",6/2/15,1
lossyrob,"the problem is, for UInt16, if you had a value that in the signed version represented Short.MinValue, but in unsigned was an actual value, that gets converted to NODATA",6/2/15,1
lossyrob,which destroys info,6/2/15,1
pomadchin,** the line above was a NoData solution for UInt16 converted to Int32,6/2/15,1
pomadchin,for Int16 -32768,6/2/15,1
lossyrob,"```scala> Short.MinValue & 0xFFFFres0: Int = 32768```",6/2/15,1
pomadchin,not sure that it is a good idea to convert uint16 to int16,6/2/15,1
lossyrob,so if any values in the raster were 32768 (which is half of the max unsigned short value),6/2/15,1
lossyrob,haha no it_„Žs not,6/2/15,1
lossyrob,but in java,6/2/15,1
pomadchin,:D,6/2/15,1
lossyrob,we don_„Žt have uint,6/2/15,1
pomadchin,yes ):,6/2/15,1
lossyrob,we only have signed types,6/2/15,1
lossyrob,so_„_it_„Žs going to take some trickery to get around that,6/2/15,1
lossyrob,and hopefully I can pull that off,6/2/15,1
pomadchin,hope this thing gonna help `>>`,6/2/15,1
lossyrob,haha yup it_„Žll have to,6/2/15,1

pomadchin,"quick google: https://github.com/nystrom/scala-unsigned/tree/master/src/main/scala/passera/unsigned",6/2/15,1
lossyrob,seems silly not to use Value types there,6/2/15,1
lossyrob,oh he did. haha,6/2/15,1
lossyrob,nvm,6/2/15,1
pomadchin,::DD,6/2/15,1
lossyrob,"another problem I_„Žm running into: having a required NoData value for byte (Byte.MinValue) takes a value out of the 0 - 255 space. Which when converting to Int, reads as Int.MinValue. But if we don_„Žt want any of our precious 256 values to be turned into Int.MinValue, we currently don_„Žt have a way to do that...",6/2/15,1
lossyrob,"so I need to make NoData optional. which breaks a really long standing (before my time) design decision, and requires some pretty deep changes.",6/2/15,1
lossyrob,"so, add that to the pile",6/2/15,1
lossyrob,re: that library_„_.I don_„Žt know how he_„Žs extending AnyVal and also implementing a Generic trait. I don_„Žt think you can do that without boxing,6/2/15,1
lossyrob,AnyVals have pretty delicate rules about when the compiler is going to instantiate the wrapper vs allow the primative to stay primative,6/2/15,1
pomadchin,"mb it would be usefull let to define own NoData and own types? but it sounds too generic and mb there would be problems with the scala type system",6/2/15,1
lossyrob,the scala type system could deal with it. It_„Žs just going to kill speed in a very serious way,6/2/15,1
lossyrob,"and I want to avoid that completely. One of the biggest wins of GeoTrellis is that the core stuff is fast_„_if you iterate over 1000000 cells, checking against Int.MinValue is going to be seriously faster than checking agianst some tile.noDataValue or calling `tile.isNoData(v)` or something like that",6/2/15,1
lossyrob,"we have the `isNoData(z)` implemented as a macro that inlines the conditional, it_„Žs that important to be fast",6/2/15,1
pomadchin,): have to use head alot before using type system features,6/2/15,1

allixender,"How could I create a new SparkContext with an updated cassandra SparkConf in the geotrellis-spark testing for  the Cassandra, because I think the provided SparkContext in the tests (because it has already the spark cassandra connector jar available)  uses a ""Default Configuration"", whereas for the cassandra integration tests we actually want to provide dedicated connection parameters (which are based on our EmbeddedCassandra daemon config)",6/5/15,1
allixender,@lossyrob @notthatbreezy Would it be problematic to initialise the cassandra connection details from the provided embedded cassandra config (under bla.../src/test/resources)  in the SparkConf for the SparkContext in [OnlyIfCanRunSpark.scala](https://github.com/allixender/geotrellis/blob/feature/cassandra-gsoc2015/spark/src/test/scala/geotrellis/spark/OnlyIfCanRunSpark.scala) ?,6/5/15,1

lossyrob,@allixender yes this seems like a problem with managing different spark contexts across tests,6/5/15,1
lossyrob,"one option is, do the thing that we are going to have to do anyway, and stick the cassandra stuff in it_„Žs own subproject",6/5/15,1
lossyrob,"as we currently have it, it doesn_„Žt make sense to have Accumulo and Cassandra to be in included in the main project by default",6/5/15,1

pomadchin,"very interesting to have bench comparing for the similar tasks on both dbs, or its for different tasks? o:",6/5/15,1
lossyrob,"but another thing that we_„Žd want to do, and have run into, is wanting a `testkit`. Currently the `testkit` in GeoTrellis deasl with the Akka `engine` project.

lossyrob,"If Cassandra had it_„Žs own subproject, you could manage the spark context inside that test project however you wanted",6/5/15,1
lossyrob,"@pomadchin you could still include both dependencies, and have both funcitonality. This just gives you the option to have one or the other, or none even",6/5/15,1
lossyrob,in case you are using spark only through memory or to read off local disk for instance. So you combine `geotrellis-spark` with a mix-and-match approach to the various backends that you want to use.,6/5/15,1

mpfaffenberger,Quick question from someone who's interested in the project -- A lot of raster data is unsigned. How does GeoTrellis deal with the fact that Java doesn't support unsigned arithmetic? Thanks all!,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,@mpfaffenberger what a greatly timed question. I_„Žm currently working on a feature to add UByte and UShort types,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,all of the access to values in geotrellis uses Ints or Doubles,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,so you get something like this,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,"```scalaval path: String = ???val geoTiff = SingleBandGeoTiff(path)val tile = geoTiff.tile//get value at col 10 row 20val z: Int = tile.get(10, 20)// map over valuestile.map { z: Int => z + 1 }// map over doubles (slower)tile.mapDouble { z: Double => z + 1.1 }```",6/6/15,1
lossyrob,currently the GeoTiff reader reads unsigned types as upcasting them to the next type. So it_„Žll convert `unit16` into Int. It actually converts `uint32` into Float.,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,"`byte` is unsigned in GDAL, but our bytes are signed. I_„Žm fixing this now to include a `TypeByte` and `TypeUByte` so that the integer and double access functions will return the correct values",6/6/15,1
lossyrob,"Have you run into a lot of `uint32` data? We don_„Žt really have a good solution for this (besides converting to floats or doubles). But I think in most cases it_„Žs `uint32`, `uint16`, and the unsigned `byte`",6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,@lossyrob -- Yeah we've run into the same deal. We used some JNI + scala trait trickery to basically bypass the JVM altogether. At this point we essentially write C++ in Scala. We use OpenCV Matrices to do most of the arithmetic operations. Most of our data is unsigned byte or unsigned short. I can't say I've run into a lot of 32 bit unsigned data. But yeah... I think maybe Java 8 might have some options for unsigned primitives. ,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,"So to sum up, we open with GDAL Java bindings, and pipe that input directly to OpenCV Java bindings. ",6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,"Probably not appropriate for all types of rasters, but it suited our needs for the time being.",6/6/15,1
lossyrob,"That sounds interesting. I_„Žve been playing around with the OpenCV bindings a bit, but haven_„Žt added any library support for it yet",6/6/15,1
lossyrob,Is the code open so I can take a look?,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,"It's not open at the moment, I'm trying to work with GeoMesa folks though. So maybe soon?",6/6/15,1
lossyrob,"On the roadmap is to create a translation between GeoTrellis rasters and OpenCV types, so you can do a lot of the processing in Scala and lean on OpenCV for their awesome algorithms",6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,That's a good plan I think.,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,Curse designers of Java for not including unsigned :(,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,"How have you found the OpenCV bindings? I looked under the covers about how they were generated, it_„Žs really complicated",6/6/15,1
lossyrob,not using something like SWIG like GDAL,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,"I wanted to use the Stitcher but it_„Žs currently not in the Java API_„_looked into writing the binding, and then turned away and ran :)",6/6/15,1
lossyrob,yeah that was an interesting design decision that we all have to live with now forever,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,I've tried to keep myself as blind as possible to C++. I found it to be similar to GDAL's SWIG bindings though. I read on their site that they use a parser over the C++ code to generate the JNI stuff. Seems similar to SWIG. You can compile it with Python and Java support. If you run with Java it uses ANT to make the .jar...  then you can just toss it up on an artifactory or something.,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,"Swig has an interesting way of making cross language bindings_„_and basically you write some C++ classes with some additional syntax. And then the framework generates it_„_you have to write type mappings, but it_„Žs mostely compile safe.",6/6/15,1
lossyrob,OpenCV is just straight up generating text source code,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,using regex_„Žs and such,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,Gotcha.,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,So ... some stuff is missing in the Java API. That's interesting.,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,yeah would def be cool to see how your using OpenCV bindings once they let you open up the source :) I could probably learn a lot from it,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,"Well, they also cut a release a few days ago.",6/6/15,1
lossyrob,"I was working off of master a couple of months ago, but let me check again...",6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,3.0.0 is out apparently.,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,With new feature detectors :),6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,"Yeah, I'll talk to my company. At the very least I'd like to write a blog post or something.",6/6/15,1
lossyrob,hmm yeah as far as I can find there isn_„Žt java bindings for the stitcher,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,That's rough... I wonder if we can submit a ticket or something.,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,That would make sense,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,what feature extraction are you using? That_„Žs a topic I don_„Žt know nearly as much as I want to about.,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,Well... the only option that isn't patented is ORB.,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,Oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,It's a detector that responds nicely to high frequency changes. ,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,SIFT is also available (Scale Invariant Feature Transform I think?),6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,but costs an arm/leg.,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,patented...,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,oof,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,what does ORB produce? edges?,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,keypoints,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,usually you'll see them fit around edges though... you can configure it,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,You kinda have to engineer it around your goal.,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,hmmm. So a goal that I think a lot of us have is to extract vector data out of imagery,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,Yeah definitely.,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,is that a good approach for that task?,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,I'm not entirely sure.,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,I think you definitely want to use an edge detector ,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,"There's one built into OpenCV that's not so amazing, but blazing fast",6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,it's called Canny,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,You should be able to get LineStrings out of Canny,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,and you could stitch together those linestrings into polygons,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,"nice. out of ignorance, what_„Žs the difference between Edge Detection and Feature Extraction?",6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,"You'll get pixel coordinate values out of opencv, then you just apply the GeoT from GDAL on those and reproject... then make a well known text?",6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,Damn.... good question.,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,"what we_„Žd want to do is transfer the geotrellis raster to OpenCV, get the coordinate values, then translate it into geotrellis.vector.Geometry objects (wrapper around JTS)",6/6/15,1
lossyrob,so you can one-liner some polygon extraction. that_„Žs the dream anyway,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,"I think edge detection is a potential step of image segmentation. If you were doing some kind of object (cats or faces) I think you'd want to segment using an edge detector, and then use feature extraction to characterize each segment into a matrix.",6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,(smaller matrix),6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,Might not be the right person to ask though.,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,"So feature extraction is more in the traditional ML sense, as in preparing input vectors to models?",6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,Precisely,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,awesome. thanks for clearing that up,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,But you have to slam the matrix down into a vector,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,A lot of neural network papers suggest the pooling operation,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,max/mean on columns basically,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,hmmm,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,"This is cool stuff, glad to know someone who knows a lot more than me on this subject :)",6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,"Dude, I feel like I'm the one in the dark. :)",6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,These are tough problems for sure.,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,Been keeping my eye on GeoTrellis for a few weeks now.,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,You guys support cassandra?,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,"I_„Žm going to ping you once GeoTrellis CV work starts. Also @alasin is doing an Google Summer of Code project on cloud detection/removal and has a CV background, might be interesting to talk to.",6/6/15,1
lossyrob,We have a cassandra feature branch,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,and a GSoC student working to get it fully supported,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,the problem with cassandra is range queries,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,"If we have our tiles stored in cassandra, we can pull them out one by one no problem",6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,Ah... so space filling curves are out of the picture?,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,Or you just have to do one query per possible entry in the range?,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,"but if we want to take a 3D space and only pull those tiles, then we translate that into SFC ranges, which can be a whole lot of ranges",6/6/15,1
lossyrob,and so to be efficient it would have to handle the many SFC index ranges really fast,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,Accumulo kicks ass at it,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,Cassandra doesn_„Žt even support OR clauses,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,Yeah... HBase and Accumulo are similar right? Does HBase support range queries?,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,"so I can_„Žt do `where (r1Min <= index AND index < r1Max) OR (r2Min <= AND index <r2Max)`, only the `AND`s ",6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,Ouch.,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,"yes, Ihaven_„Žt worked with HBase, but as far as I know",6/6/15,1
lossyrob,they are sort of drop in,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,Gotcha.,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,"we want to support HBase, got some questions about htat at the Spark Summit",6/6/15,1
lossyrob,and our answer for why we went with Accumulo over HBase was basically_„_well GeoMesa was using it so we checked it out lol,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,GeoMesa's currently refactoring a little to support HBase as well.,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,nice,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,"We have abstracted over our backends, so it wouldn_„Žt be too tough to support it",6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,Yeah that's really good.,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,"it_„Žs how we_„Žre supporting HDFS, Accumulo, Cassandra, and S3_„_would be adding it to the list",6/6/15,1
lossyrob,"that_„Žs assuming we find a way to do the range indexing on Cassandra. Even if not, it seems like it will be a good option for just serving out single tiles fast",6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,That's definitely a +. Solid design choices.,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,Seems like cassandra is geared towards a different kind of data.,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,I didn't know that it doesn't support ranges though...,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/imgproc/imgtrans/canny_detector/canny_detector.html,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,That's an example of your edge detector,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,"In that post, they use a slider to have the user choose an appropriate threshold... For your use case you will have to create an algorithm that chooses an adaptive threshold.",6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,OpenCV should have some builtin stuff for that too.,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,yeah that was a dissapointing find,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,but I think we can get around it.,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,we have some good people on it  (@allixender) ,6/6/15,1
mpfaffenberger,Good to know. It's been good chatting. Glad I decided to drop by.,6/6/15,1
lossyrob,"ok cool. I_„Žm excited to start to try out Canny. It_„Žs not too far down the task list, but there_„Žs a lot of stuff above it (as always)",6/6/15,1
lossyrob,yeah thanks for stopping by!,6/6/15,1
allixender,"@lossyrob @mpfaffenberger yes, the querying in cassandra certainly is a bit special. Range Queries are supported, but they heavily depend on the indexing scheme and I think the data type. You still can do a full table scan (with `ALLOW FILTERING`) and filter the result set (not quite ideal). The Cassandra data model for GeoTrellis use might need to get redesigned. I am sort of switching between getting the unit tests nice and learning the GeoTrellis filtering and thinking/playing with the Cassandra indexing options",6/8/15,1
allixender,"@lossyrob @notthatbreezy https://github.com/allixender/geotrellis/commit/9c4ef7f4cea786004035faf315a9e4319ab0cd0b fixes the embedded cassandra unit tests ( https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/issues/1097 ). Shall I issue a pull request to upstream/feature/cassandra or just continue for now? I would now start to look into layer structure, indexing and filtering, I guess?",6/8/15,1
lossyrob,"If you have fixes to the unit tests, would be good to get that into feature/cassandra, so PR.",6/8/15,1
lossyrob,"@allixender and we can go back and forth on that if we need to (which is nice about branches/PRs, if you have to make fixes you can just switch back, make the change, push and switch back to whatever else you_„Žre doing)",6/8/15,1
lossyrob,"if you need to you can branch from your branch, so that you can have your changes in what you_„Žre working on. Most likely we will merge in the unit test PR before we merge in any of your other work.",6/8/15,1
lossyrob,"The next thing would be to update the feature/cassandra branch to master, with the API changes from https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/pull/1102",6/8/15,1
lossyrob,@echeipesh is working on getting that PR merged,6/8/15,1
alasin,"Is there a way to map tile values on the basis of (x, y) coordinates rather than their values? Something like this `tile.map((col, row) => if(col > ....) ....)`? Or some way in which we can iterate over a tile like `for{ i <- 0 to cols; j <- 0 to rows} tile.get(i, j)`, check a condition and create a new tile out of this?",6/8/15,1
lossyrob,"Hey @alasin_„_good question. Previous to the PR I merged in with the MultiBand/GeoTiff changes (https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/pull/1066), we would always do something like this",6/8/15,1
lossyrob,"```scalacfor(0)(_ < tile.rows, _ + 1) { row =>  cfor(0)(_ < tile.cols, _ + 1) { col =>    val v = tile.get(col, row)    val z = someFunction(col, row, v)    newTile.set(col, row, z)  }}```",6/8/15,1
lossyrob,so we_„Žd iterate over the tile and set things into a mutable tile we had created above that code,6/8/15,1
lossyrob,"but now, I made changes to have a map function do this:",6/8/15,1
lossyrob,"```scalatile.map { (col, row, z) => z + col + row }//ortile.map(someFunction) // where someFunction: (Int, Int, Int) => Int```",6/8/15,1
lossyrob,the reason why we never had that before is because of Boxing and specialization,6/8/15,1
lossyrob,"which are fun topics, that I won_„Žt get into too much here",6/8/15,1
lossyrob,"but suffice it to say that Function2 is specialized, but Function3 is not specialized",6/8/15,1
lossyrob,"so `f: (T, T) => T` will not box primitives, so you won_„Žt box `f: (Int, Int) => Int`",6/8/15,1
lossyrob,but Function3 will box integers. Which makes things very slow.,6/8/15,1
lossyrob,It took some macro magic to get around that: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/macros/src/main/scala/geotrellis/macros/TileMacros.scala#L34,6/8/15,1
lossyrob,"so, to answer your question, use the map method that takes col and row (or mapDouble if you are using doubles)",6/8/15,1
alasin,Cool. That's exactly what I was looking for :),6/8/15,1
jamesmcclain,@lossyrob : I have created a pull request: https://github.com/WikiWatershed/model-my-watershed/pull/318,6/8/15,1

lossyrob,nope,6/8/15,1

lossyrob,"so it_„Žs the state of master right now, but moving forward I dont_„Ž want to continually update snapshots (but you shouldn_„Žt rely on them remaining the same)",6/8/15,1

lossyrob,I_„Žll publish a milestone release which you_„Žll be able to point to with stability,6/8/15,1
lossyrob,that_„Žs a good question. what do you think?,6/8/15,1
jamesmcclain,"Yeah, I was going to ask if the snapshot updates or if it increments to 0.11",6/8/15,1
lossyrob,so far I haven_„Žt really been using it much. but I should be. I could push out after every major PR or something,6/8/15,1
lossyrob,no it just overwrites,6/8/15,1
pomadchin,yep mb every time smth global completes,6/8/15,1
lossyrob,"the milestone will be something like `""com.azavea.geotrellis"" %% ""geotrellis-vector"" % _„ñ0.10.0-M1_„` and will be available on maven central, and won_„Žt ever change",6/8/15,1
pomadchin,"So then, I guess, filter refactor pr will require republishing",6/8/15,1
lossyrob,yeah,6/8/15,1
lossyrob,I_„Žm hoping to incorporate that into the milestone release,6/8/15,1
lossyrob,I think I have to actually,6/8/15,1
pomadchin,"Nice idea with milestones, very cool",6/8/15,1
lossyrob,"so I_„Žll publish a snapshot after that, and then after testing publish the milestone",6/8/15,1

lossyrob,@notthatbreezy what about rebasing a branch where you are not the only committer?,6/10/15,1
notthatbreezy,"yeah, it does get tricky in that situation and require some coordination. I would save rebasing until the last possible moment (right before doing a merge into master), or until it's necessary to continue work on the branch, otherwise you can end up with some really funky history in master",6/10/15,1
lossyrob,"so you would recommend rebasing, which rewrites commit history for commits that aren_„Žt yours?",6/10/15,1
notthatbreezy,"I don't have a big problem with that no, as long as the other people working on that branch are aware of it and know to do a fresh checkout/force pull before continuing work",6/10/15,1

lossyrob,cool thanks!,6/11/15,1
zifeo,"I got a two random questions when going through the code of spark version:- what are the advantages of using a callback class instead of a function type ?- what are the advantages of using mapPairs instead of mapTiles when only mapping on Tile (i.e. in `op/local/LocalRasterRDDMethods`)?",6/11/15,1
lossyrob,who uses a callback? is it the rasterizer?,6/11/15,1
zifeo,yes,6/11/15,1
lossyrob,one sec,6/11/15,1
lossyrob,ok,6/11/15,1
lossyrob,"so, the rasterizer API sucks. feel free to rewrite",6/11/15,1
lossyrob,but there is a reason the Callback is there,6/11/15,1
lossyrob,"and it_„Žs because of specialization and boxing, which is a common theme",6/11/15,1
lossyrob,"but, it actually doesn_„Žt have to be there now. So, `Callback` used to take another parameter",6/11/15,1

lossyrob,it used to pass in the geometry for each callback call,6/11/15,1
lossyrob,"which was totally unneeded, so I removed it",6/11/15,1
lossyrob,"*but*, when it was there, that made Callback a thing that mimiced Function3",6/11/15,1
lossyrob,https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.11.x/src/library/scala/Function3.scala,6/11/15,1
lossyrob,if you look at the difference between Function3 and Function2:,6/11/15,1
lossyrob,https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.11.x/src/library/scala/Function2.scala,6/11/15,1
lossyrob,"you_„Žll see what_„Žs going on, and why we would want a specificly typed thing that represented our function with 3 parameters.",6/11/15,1
lossyrob,"Function2 is specialized. that means, for primitives, it doesn_„Žt box. Boxing is evil, if performance is good (which it very much is)",6/11/15,1
lossyrob,so we had a Function3 passed in that was being called for each cell value under a polygon lets say. That_„Žs a lot of boxed calls,6/11/15,1
lossyrob,so @ahinz realized this and made a change to use a specific trait.,6/11/15,1
lossyrob,that sped up performance dramatically.,6/11/15,1
lossyrob,"then, I refactored out the geometry call. which dropped that down to Function2, which is specialized. So there_„Žs no need for it anymore.",6/11/15,1
lossyrob,"Also, I devised a way to have specific traits implemented for things that represent Function3 +, but using macros it doesn_„Žt box. This can be seen here: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/macros/src/main/scala/geotrellis/macros/TileMacros.scala and here: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/raster/src/main/scala/geotrellis/raster/MappableTile.scala",6/11/15,1
lossyrob,"so really, any place in the codebase where we are using a specific trait to get around using Function3+ because of boxing issues, we should implement macros that do that instead. Because that makes the API nice without any cost to performance, which is sort of the holy grail in library design, at least for this library.",6/11/15,1
lossyrob,"and the Rasterizer API is in desparate need of an overhaul. I really don_„Žt like using it, and we can do better. Feel free to pitch ideas or PRs :) but I haven_„Žt gotten around to revamping it yet_„_it_„Žs on the list",6/11/15,1
zifeo,"Okay, much more clearer now, thank you ! And what about the mapPairs/mapTiles thing ?",6/12/15,1
lossyrob,"mapPairs for an RDD maps over both the key and the tile. mapTiles only maps over the tiles. So they do the same thing, it_„Žs more about what the function passed in gets/returns",6/12/15,1
zifeo,"so we could replace `rasterRDD.mapPairs { case (t, r) => (t, Sinh(r)) }` by `rasterRDD.mapTile(Sinh(_))`, there is no implicit or hidden trick ?",6/12/15,1

allixender,"@lossyrob @notthatbreezy based on `git fetch upstream & git merge upstream/master. then deal with all the merge conflicts` I updated my github clone/branch from geotrellis/master.

vishalanand,I was looking into Apache Math3 library in GT and realized we are using the version 3.2 [here](https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/project/Dependencies.scala#L55). And I found there is a [3.5_version](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/changes-report.html) of the API which is backward compatible. It has some nice features added.  I was thinking if we should update the two year old dependency to the new one?,6/18/15,1
echeipesh,Sounds good!,6/18/15,1
vishalanand,Should I do a PR?,6/18/15,1
echeipesh,"I think it can be part of the Kriging PR, since you_„Žre going to be using it there directly. I don_„Žt think any other branch would benefit from upgrade right away?",6/18/15,1

allixender,"@lossyrob @notthatbreezy For the IngestCommand and most of Cassandra functionality, the cassandra.host config also needs to be registered in the SparkContext at the point of creation of the SparkContext, not just adding it later in the IngestCommand",6/19/15,1
allixender,How can I (we) sort of sutainably check if a cassandra host param is mentioned in the spark submit command?,6/19/15,1
allixender,"basically, the datastax spark cassandra connector provides the CassandraRRD abstractions, but It will need the `sparkConf.set(""spark.cassandra.connection.host"", args.host)` paramater being set before the actual SparkContext ist created from that conf",6/19/15,1
allixender,"I have tackled that in the tests, where I could add it statically in the config",6/19/15,1
allixender,"```scalasparkConf.set(""spark.cassandra.connection.host"", host)      .set(""spark.cassandra.connection.rpc.port"", rpcPort.toString)      .set(""spark.cassandra.connection.native.port"", nativePort.toString)    val sparkContext = SparkUtils.createLocalSparkContext(""local[8]"", ""Test Context"", sparkConf)```",6/19/15,1
allixender,but at runtime such a parameter would only be needed if there is actually cassandra functionality required,6/19/15,1
allixender,"so, a simple ingest command via spark submit would need to be able to register these parameters",6/19/15,1
allixender,"I am now looking into SparkArgs.scala, `SparkUtils.createLocalSparkContext(sparkMaster, appName, sparkConf)`",6/19/15,1
allixender,"if I am not mistaken, this is the place where `spark.cassandra.connection.host=127.0.0.1` could be picked up?",6/19/15,1

allixender,no prob @Manuri . What paramters do you mean? Do you mean if Proj4 can read WKT?,6/19/15,1

notthatbreezy,"@allixender -- yup, --conf is definitely the way to go for that type of stuff",6/19/15,1
notthatbreezy,"@manuri one resource that might be helpful to compare formats like proj4 and WKT is spatialreference.org. (e.g. http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/4326/ will show how to represent that CRS in WKT, proj4, etc.)",6/19/15,1
notthatbreezy,Also maybe the WKT specification if you haven't looked at that - http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/12-063r5/12-063r5.html -- neither of these really help with detailing how to convert between the two though,6/19/15,1

allixender,Hey @echeipesh would it make sense to reconcile this idea with the further development for the benchmark project? To get an idea how well the cassandra stuff actually performs I'd like to look into getting the benchmark (which looks like a little bit hard-coded towards Accumolo though),6/24/15,1
allixender,... getting the benchmark working with a cassandra benchmark,6/24/15,1
echeipesh,"@allixender if you_„Žre talking about the bencharks we_„Žve been doing that sounds like geotrellis internal testing.

allixender,"hey @echeipesh @lossyrob @notthatbreezy I created a pull request https://github.com/geotrellis/benchmark/pull/5 for https://github.com/geotrellis/benchmark so it would compile against current geotrellis master brnach artefacts.

jamesmcclain,I would like to ask a follow-up question to my one from yesterday.  I have discovered what the problem is: the the spray system (via the underlying akka actor system) seems to be forking new JVMs to handle requests.  Those JVMs are not able to find some parts of the spark library which are needed to call into geotrellis.,7/8/15,1

jamesmcclain,"I also tried explicitly setting the classpath, but the new JVMs don't seem to pick up on that",7/8/15,1

echeipesh,@pomadchin haven_„Žt cooked up an ingest yet. Sounds like you have a multi-band dataset you want to play with ?,7/8/15,1
echeipesh,@jamesmcclain That doesn_„Žt sound right. sbt can fork a jvm to run a project or if you_„Žre using `re-start` sbt plugin that will do a similar thing. But the class paths should be identical between forked and non-forked jvms. What are the errors that you are getting ?,7/8/15,1

lossyrob,"if anyone here knows how to use the PrecisionModel in JTS effectively, especially when faced with TopologyErrors, we could use some help",7/23/15,1
lossyrob,@zifeo @allixender one thing that we need to do is make this configurable: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/vector/src/main/scala/geotrellis/vector/GeomFactory.scala#L22,7/23/15,1
lossyrob,"so that we can have arbitrary precision models. So in your test Teo, you have some very precise values_„_perhaps the user would just set the precision model on some object so that the geometries created would use thatprecision model",7/23/15,1
lossyrob,"I think we discussed using an implicit precision model that would be taken for each of the geometry construction methods, but didn_„Žt end up going that route. That would proliferate a lot of (implicit p: PrecisionModel) additions to the `geotrellis.vector` codebase",7/23/15,1
lossyrob,"which might be a bit ugly, but might also be the right way to go about it",7/23/15,1
pomadchin,"/offtop/@lossyrob geotrellis inside got functions (intersect, covers, contains) and for extent:`polygon1.envelope.contains(polygon2.envelope)`what differs?",7/23/15,1
lossyrob,"but I guess a question is..is there some default precision model that we can use that will always be precise enough, and also solve the TopologyErrors?",7/23/15,1
lossyrob,"@pomadchin not much. We just had an Extent implementation before we started using JTS wrappers. So all of that was already written, and doing the straight math, which is easy, for that sort of stuff is going to be faster than hitting up JTS envelopes_„_at least that_„Žs my thought. It_„Žs definitely not going to be slower.",7/23/15,1
lossyrob,"So the Extent we use for envelopes is our own type, and not the JTS Envelope type",7/23/15,1
lossyrob,"yeah JTS does some casting and such to Geometries I was trying to avoid. I forget exactly what it was, but I remember find a step in using JTS envelops instead of our Extent that would produce some more bytecode/steps",7/23/15,1

jamesmcclain,"Hello, can anyone share a pointer to the best place to learn about using S3 catalogues with Geotrellis?",7/24/15,1
echeipesh,There is not much in terms of documentation. I can say they will behave about the same as any other catalog. You can see some uses of it in the tests: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/test/scala/geotrellis/spark/io/s3/S3RasterCatalogSpec.scala,7/24/15,1
echeipesh,Other than that I can answer questions.,7/24/15,1
jamesmcclain,"Okay, thanks for the pointer.  I will give that a read.",7/24/15,1
jamesmcclain,"I have the following code:```Scala  implicit val sc: SparkContext = SparkUtils.createSparkContext(""Geoprocessing"", new SparkConf())  val catalogue = S3RasterCatalog(bucket, prefix)  val nlcd = catalogue.query[SpatialKey]((layerName, layerZoom)).toRDD```which gives me the error```GeopServiceActor.scala:39: value query is not a member of geotrellis.spark.io.s3.S3RasterCatalog[error]   val nlcd = catalogue.query[SpatialKey]((layerName, layerZoom)).toRDD[error]                        ^```",7/24/15,1
jamesmcclain,"This confusing, as this code https://github.com/OpenTreeMap/otm-modeling/commit/1156291d4e80319c948344d0638b936d12636bd7 seems to be doing a very similar thing",7/24/15,1
jamesmcclain,"There must be a subtlety that I am missing, but I am not seeing it",7/24/15,1
echeipesh,"yeah, that_„Žs not right. It_„Žs a pretty recent refactor, make sure you are pulling in latest GT version? I assume you_„Žre not able to do that on other catalogs (or is this the first)",7/24/15,1
jamesmcclain,This is my first attempt at working with a catalogue,7/24/15,1
jamesmcclain,I am using `0.10-SNAPSHOT`,7/24/15,1
jamesmcclain,"When you say it is not right, do you mean what I wrote is not  right, or that that error should not be appearing?",7/24/15,1
lossyrob,that the error shouldn_„Žt be appearing,7/24/15,1
lossyrob,"also, you_„Žre note constraining that query by any bounds, which will load the entire layer. You_„Žll want to do something like ```catalogue.query[SpatialKey](LayerId(layerName, layerZoom)).where(Intersects(someBounds)).toRDD```",7/24/15,1
jamesmcclain,"I see.  I just destroyed my .ivy2 directory and did an sbt clean, and I am still getting the same behaviour.  My Build.scala is pointing to `0.10-SNAPSHOT`, so I'm fairly confident that I am not using a stale version of Geotrellis.",7/24/15,1
lossyrob,and you published local with an up-to-date master of geotrellis?,7/24/15,1
echeipesh,,7/24/15,1
echeipesh,btw: geotrellis project include a plugin for cleaning local cache selectivly: you can do `clean-cache` and it will do so for the sub-project you are in. Will save blowing away whole ivy cache.,7/24/15,1
jamesmcclain,I have not done a public local since I destroyed my .ivy2 directory (minutes ago),7/24/15,1
jamesmcclain,"I think Justin is using the same snapshot that I am, and I am looking at his code",7/24/15,1
jamesmcclain,"Thanks for the tip re: `clean-cache`, will write that down",7/24/15,1
jamesmcclain,"I meant to say ""publish local"" not ""public local"" above",7/24/15,1
jamesmcclain,I am essentially just using Justin's code as a model: https://github.com/OpenTreeMap/otm-modeling/blob/1156291d4e80319c948344d0638b936d12636bd7/src/main/scala/ModelingServiceSparkActor.scala,7/24/15,1
pomadchin,sometimes better to clean ivy2 cache by hands and project target dirs ,7/24/15,1
jamesmcclain,"Looking at his `build.scala`, he (seems to be) using the same version of Geotrellis that I am",7/24/15,1
jamesmcclain,feelsbadman.jpg,7/24/15,1
lossyrob,you should use publish local,7/24/15,1
lossyrob,to publish your own 0.10.0-SNAPSHOT,7/24/15,1
lossyrob,"if you inlcude the sonatype snapshot repo, you_„Žll get a 0.10 snapshot out of it, but it will be old",7/24/15,1
echeipesh,"hehe. What is probably happening is there is geotrellis-spark-10-SNAPSHOT somewhere on maven. If you don_„Žt pre-empt it by publishing your own version to local cache, sbt will go looking and find something.",7/24/15,1
lossyrob,so just do a ./publish-local.sh in an up-to-date geotrellis checkout to fix that,7/24/15,1
jamesmcclain,"Okay, will try.  Will there be any fallout re: the geoprocessing VM in MMW?  In other words, when people provision that and try to use it, will it work?",7/24/15,1
jamesmcclain,Or will they need to build a fresh Geotrellis as part of the provisioning process?,7/24/15,1
lossyrob,"if you switch the version to 0.10.0-M1, does that work?",7/24/15,1
lossyrob,"because unless you need stuff that was added to GeoTrellis after the M1 release, you can use that",7/24/15,1
jamesmcclain,"I will try, but Justin seems to have switched to `0.10-SNAPSHOT` and it works for him",7/24/15,1
lossyrob,that_„Žs because he_„Žs publishing local,7/24/15,1
jamesmcclain,"I'll try, then report back ina few minutes",7/24/15,1
jamesmcclain,"Okay, I must not be understanding",7/24/15,1
lossyrob,"if you need more up to date geotrellis, yeah the publish-local will have to be part of the provisioning step",7/24/15,1
jamesmcclain,I thought that pulling from sonatype obviated the need to publish local?,7/24/15,1

echeipesh,Let me take a look at that,7/29/15,1
echeipesh,"@zifeo just taking a quick look at it, the ingest, pyramid commands are all orphaned as of now. Their function should be performed by a project using spark-etl. The calculate command is outside of that usecase, but its really just a stub. Next time we come across a need to do something like that the spark-etl project can be augmented with ability to read from a catalog, not just a bunch of images.",7/30/15,1

At some point some thought will need to be given to how to generalize gt-admin to work with sources other than accumulo. (it would be very helpful to run it on an S3 catalog for instance). Perhaps then sumac can be dumped for a more robust argument parser, like scallop or scopt. ",7/30/15,1

lossyrob,"The idea is that `spark-etl` would be an easy way to write your own _„ñingest_„ (we_„Žre now using the ETL nomenclature) inside your own project. So for instance Chattanooga might have an etl project, or just a simpe object, that would do the necessary ingest for that project.",7/30/15,1

lossyrob,_„Žs in the works for sure. The single threaded version is there. just the serialization issues need to be solved before we get a Catalog for them!,7/30/15,1

lossyrob,if I do `gdalinfo` on those netCDFs,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,each month is represented by one band,7/30/15,1

rahulpalamuttam,i see,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,okay i get it,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,which can get large and decrease the ability to parallelize over them,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,its the classic split by time,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"so I wrote some python/rasterio code that used SQS and EC2 to chunk out the netCDF tiles, which meant just grabbing all the bands out and exporting them as single bands and saving them to s3",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,and writing the ISO_TIME into a GeoTIFF tag,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"so that later I could read each month-tile as one banded GeoTiff, and get the metadata I needed",7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,its all fairly new terminology to me - so you'll have to bear with me - but i've been trying to do something similar with spark and netcdf data,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,i've see you have a rasterRDD and a tileRDD,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"but if your netCDFs aren_„Žt too large, and your ok with installing gdal java bindings on each worker, you could use this: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/io/hadoop/formats/NetCdfInputFormat.scala",7/30/15,1

rahulpalamuttam,tiles as in geospatial tiles,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,A _„ñTile_„ is really just a piece of a raster,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,like a chunk. A raster is something that can mean the whole layer,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,to over simplify tile = 1 box on a grid?,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"Yeah kind of, but each tile has like 256x256 pixels say",7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,okay awesome and you do some sort of smoothing across the pixels?,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,how do you mean?,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,well it's just some of the netcdf data are grids with varying resolution,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,and they're many files split across time,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,hmmm yeah. our netCDF_„Žs were all of the same resolution,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,okay gotcha,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,ur dealing with a specific netcdf source,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,"our netcdf's could have many variables, and varying resolutions",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"dealing with multi-resolution layers is something we_„Žre working on, but for now we fit everything into the same resolution grid layer_„_right now it_„Žs jsut according to the TMS-like `{z}/{x}/{y}` scheme, but soon it will be so that you can define a custom tile layout",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,but we_„Žd still keep it one resolution per layer,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,i see,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,what do you have to do between resolutions?,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"like, are there operations you have to do between the different resolution data?",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,the one thing we_„Žve done is just resample down to the highest resolution,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,well its more of an experiment  - but my basic task right now,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"which is a bit poor on disk space usage. dynamic resampling would be nice, not implemented yet though.",7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,is reading in a bunch of netcdf files,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam, and reducing the resolution or I guess u could say regridding,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,so here's the pipeline,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,netcdf file -> rdd (inside the rdd is a multidimensional array structure),7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,each variable array is copied to the array structure and then we do operations on that array,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,it was really a simple introduction task,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"and the _„ƒarray structure_„Ž, how many dimensions is that per variable?",7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,well anywhere from 1 - 5,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,most are lat/lon,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,but there's lat/lon/height etc.,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"well, a raster tile is pretty much set to a gridded space of width and height",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,and then you can hold tiles in other dimensions by having the keys be multidimensional,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"so for instance we have a `SpaceTimeKey`, which has a spatial and temporal component",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"and a `RasterRDD[SpaceTimeKey]` is an `RDD[(SpaceTimeKey, Tile)]`",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,so the actual value of the Key-Value RDD is still a 2D tile,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,i see,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,that's interesting,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,so you have already pre-computed the dimension pairs for different grids you could have,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,i hope that made sense,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,hmm not sure what you mean by that,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,haha,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,so the different tile u have,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,are associated with the key,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,right.,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,and the keys represent points in some bounded space,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,yes,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"which in our case are always at least in the spatial 2 dimensions, in a discreet coordinate space",7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,but the keys themselves tell u what your dimensions are as well,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"and for SpaceTimeKey, in 2D discreet coordinate space + continuous time",7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,awesome,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,yeah. And the key is set for the type of RDD your working on,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,so all values are the same. So no dimension mixing...,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,so the pysical tile is the 2d spatial tile,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"we do want to have a function that scopes down a RasterRDD[SpaceTimeKey] to a RasterRDD[SpatialKey], but taking a time slice. ",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,yeah,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,and u split it across time,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,the tiles are split across time,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,actually both time and space,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"right. So I have like, 1000 tiles that reperesnt the temperature data for one month in 2020",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"and another 1000 tiles that represent the next month, and so on",7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,awesome,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"all in the same RDD, with different SpaceTimeKeys",7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,awesome,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"where SpaceTimeKey is a case class of `case class SpaceTimeKey(col: Int, row: Int, time: DateTime)`",7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,so here's my next question,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,each spacetime key is a tuple,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,what's the value? a matrix?,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,it_„Žs a `Tile` type,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,which is like a matrix yes,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,a tensor of rank 2 - just to be clear,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"has it_„Žs own `cols x rows` structure, wich are _„ñpixel_„ values",7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,great,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"yeah. But because they represent spatial values, we can_„Žt really do matrix maths on them",7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,so u lost me there,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,there_„Žs specific geospatial operations that you use with them,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,which is what geotrellis is all about,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,i thought they were temp values,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"Right, but each cell represents a physical space",7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,right,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,so multiplying two rasters doesn_„Žt make sense to do in the matrix way,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,so if u wanted to do a reduce over a particular space key over all time,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"like get average temperature for an area, right",7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,yea,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"yeah, it_„Žs an aggregation operation",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"map each of the keys to the same time, say.",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,or move it to SpatialKey,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,like,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,so u can go from spatialtimekey -> spatialkey,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"```scalaval rdd: RasterRDD[SpaceTimeKey] = ???rdd.map { case (key, tile) => (key.spatialComponent, tile) }       .reduceByKey { (t1, t2) => t1 + t2 }       // some other stuff```",7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,nice,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,well there_„Žs some trickery there,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,because `RasterRDD` holds on to metadata,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,and uses that metadata to do spatial operations and the like,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,so if you change the key type_„_we don_„Žt have good support for that,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,okay that's fair,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"but you can do `RasterRDD[K] => RDD[(T, V)]` just fine",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,if that makes sense,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,"Key -> Time, Value?",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"so change the key type, but you then are working with the _„ñraw_„ key-value pair",7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,hmm okay,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"so `RasterRDD[SpaceTimeKey]` is a wrapped `RDD[(SpaceTimeKey, Tile)]`",7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,oh gotcha,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"so you can do `RasterRDD[SpaceTimeKey] -> RDD[(SpatialKey, Tile)]` just fine",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,but you lose metadta,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,i see,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,so here's my next question,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,if u keep coordinates in space and time,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,hmm actually i lost the question - it was a certain use case that dealt with data locality,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,do u have any issues with re-shuffling the data?,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,if that needs to ever be done in your pipeline of operations,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,how do you mean reshuffling?,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"shuffling happens, yeah",7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,so using apache spark,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"and we_„Žre actually going to do some work that will help in shuffle steps, by assigning partitioners based on the index space",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"but right now, we have our storage mechanisms lined up (well Accumulo and HDFS at least)",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"where if you store the same layers in the same index space (which requires same resolution, same layout)",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"then those tiles will live on the same machines, in most cases",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"so partitions would be local to each other, and when you combine partitions, the data should be local",7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,oh okay,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,nice,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,which really helps with shuffle,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,yes absolutley,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"but the problem is, that_„Žs just the initial shuffle",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,if we don_„Žt have partitioners in place(which we currently dont),7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"then the next shuffle that happens, who knows. those new partitions after the shuffle are based on a HashPartitioner",7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,the default spark partitioner,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,so it_„Žs a matter of making a key bounds-aware partitioner and threading that through operations,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,something that @echeipesh is currently working on_„_well was until we had a series of bad serialization problems that he_„Žs fixing,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,okay so for operations on tiles,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,do u use a custom library?,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,we are the custom library :),7/30/15,1
lossyrob,GeoTrellis really started as a fast scala raster library,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,in the single threaded sense,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,are ur operations still in JVM?,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"so our `geotrellis.raster` core library is all the core types and operations, IO, stuff like that",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,yup,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,like from a linear algebra standpoint - and the libraries scala has,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,most libraries wrap around existing BLAS packages,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,that drop down to C level code and are pretty fast,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"we_„Žre very performance oriented scala project, so even though we keep it to scala, we try to make it as performant as possible",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"now, that_„Žs true BLAS is always going to be faster",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,but there_„Žs also the overhead of shipping the memory around,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,and also the added complication of interfacing with the JNI,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,though I can image that would be a really cool thing to let GeoTrellis do one day,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,"shipping the memory from ""c-space"" to jvm heap?",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,yeah back and forth,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,okay so jni does use a copy,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,and ur tiles,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,they're essentially 2d arrays,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"yeah, backed by 1d primitave arrays",7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,nice,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,data locality for the win,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"based on how wide your data is, beacuse Array[Byte] is way faster than Array[Double]",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,ha yup,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,oh nice,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,so u don't really need precision?,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"well, if you don_„Žt need it, you don_„Žt want to have it in the way of performance",7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,gotcha it makes sense,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"so an image that_„Žs a multiband tile of values 0-255, 3 bands",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,I don_„Žt want to have to convert that to Doubles to work with hit,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,because it_„Žs almost twice as slow,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,so we jump through hoops to try to keep the size of values down and performance up,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,right and im assuming its a pretty high resolution grid,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"yeah, exactly. every operation is being done millions of times",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"so a lot of thought goes into, how do we actually create loops that allow for anonymous functions to be called over tile values, while still allowing for JVM hotspotting and the like?",7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,so what exactly do you mean by multiband tile and 3 bands?,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,and how do we never ever box primitives. because that is the death of performance,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,^^,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"it just means that, there_„Žs one _„ñraster_„, but that raster consists of 3 bands, which are _„ñseparate_„ tiles (but in some file formats, pixels are interleaved between bands in storage)",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"so if I have a red channel, blue channel, and green channel",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,each takes a byte,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,oh okay ,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"and can be thought of as it_„Žs own tile, or band",7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,gotcha that makes sense,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,but the questions u asked - were exactly the questions I had in mind :),7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"and when I approached NetCDF_„Žs, I thought of them like rasters, like how GDAL thinks of rasters, and so I thought of the time dimension as bands. I know that in the scientific community they are used in a lot of different ways that I probably know nothing about",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,nice,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"alright it_„Žs pretty late here on the east coast, I have to shut it down for the night. but great talking to you, I hope you stick around the channel and would like to chat more later!",7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,yea absolutley - i really appreciate the time,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,my projects dealing with the whole scientific community behind netcdf - and you're doing alot of similar things I hope to do in the future :) ,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,I'll definitly be on to chat later,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,no problem at all.,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,that sounds awesome.,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,cheers!,7/30/15,1
zifeo,"@lossyrob @echeipesh Okay, thanks for the info. To be sure, gt-admin ingest is kind of outdated and should be replaced by etl stuff? I_„Žll go through and see what I can update",7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,@lossyrob so why again did you stick with your own tile operations over extending breeze or something else that leverages BLAS ? Were the primitive arrays really that much more effective?,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,@rahulpalamuttam it wasn_„Žt like we tried both approaches and picked one_„_when the project started it was a decision to do all native scala. So I_„Žm not sure that they would be more effective.,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"The `Tile` is a trait, and so someone could implement one that passed through to BLAS perhaps. But then again operations result in ArrayTiles_„_so that wouldn_„Žt work.",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,I guess we side stepped the issue of dealing with native bindings all together. Was that the correct decision? Perhaps depends on the operations or the use case. But I imagine it_„Žs a lot simpler from a development perspective,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,awesome thanks - I was just making sure I didn't miss something :),7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,so we've been implementing a very similar class heirarchy within a specialized RDD,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,rather than tiles we refer to them as tensors - and yea we hide the native BLAS ops behind a trait,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,*well native BLAS ops meaning breeze/nd4j/jblas - java wrappers that have already been written,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"oh nice, that sounds like similar and cool work",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,is it on github?,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,yea its on my github account for now - and it's nowhere near as developed,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,one sec,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,https://github.com/rahulpalamuttam/SciSparkTestExperiments/tree/master/src/main/scala/org/dia/tensors,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,we even keep metadata for our tensors as well - but that's really a hashmap ,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,oh very cool,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"so since you have some basic arithmentic operations between tensors implemented, it might be interesting to do a performance benchmark between the BLAS implementation and GeoTrellis",7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,of course we aren't dealing with rgb values,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,how do you get data into this?,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,exactly what I was thinking :),7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,so netcdf has a java library,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,u can get the shape of the variable and a 1 dimensional java array out of it,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,"most of the matrix libraries allow you to pass in a 1 dim array, with the dimensions",7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,"and they construct their matrix representation - DenseMatrix, INDArray, etc.",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,are the netCDF_„Žs that your thinking about using open data?,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,yea they're all out in the wild,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"because the test could just read it however each library reads it, and then we start the timer after a cached load RDD",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,so just test computation at first,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,so here's the loader file that uses the netcdf java calls,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,___,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,https://github.com/rahulpalamuttam/SciSparkTestExperiments/blob/master/src/main/scala/org/dia/loaders/NetCDFLoader.scala,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"well if I can DL the netCDF and see if our netcdf reader can read it, then taht would be pretty simple",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,where_„Žs it at?,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,it's LoadNetcdfNDVar(),7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,sorry i forget how to put linenumbers in git urls,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,you click on the line number and then copy that URL,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,https://github.com/rahulpalamuttam/SciSparkTestExperiments/blob/master/src/main/scala/org/dia/loaders/NetCDFLoader.scala#L52,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,what_„Žs the URL of the data your grabbing?,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,so it  doesn't have to be a url,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,it could be a .nc file on disk as well,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,but if u want an example url,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"ok. but I mean, for the performance test",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,if we were to do it. what dataset should we use?,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,do you know a good netcdf source?,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,because then I can download it and see if it_„Žs the type of netcdf that our reader could handle,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"ok, yeah",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,NEX data,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,I_„Žll get a url for one,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,it_„Žll be an S3 url actually.,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,it should work with any netcdf data source,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,in case your not familiar: http://aws.amazon.com/nasa/nex/,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"you_„Žd probably have to pull it down with the s3 API, like `s3cmd` first and work on the local file system",7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,here's a particular url,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,http://disc2.nascom.nasa.gov:80/opendap/TRMM_L3/TRMM_3B42_daily/2014/365/3B42_daily.2015.01.01.7.bin,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,that_„Žs pretty tiny,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,oh yea these are very small,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,i'll be back - stepping out,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,ok cool. I_„Žll fish out a s3 url for a good biggish netcdf file we could test against,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,So u load ur netcdf data into accu,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"Eh if it_„Žs small enough (2G range), I might just read it into memory and parallelize from sc",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,because load isn_„Žt what we_„Žre necessarily testing,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,i have to check the file size tho_„_downloading now,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"@zifeo refresh my memory on the status of https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/pull/1131 again?  seems like it_„Žs ready for merge, but the last commit says WIP (which is a shoddy commit msg btw ;) )",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"and also if you saw the bump by @jwalgran, this feature is useful in another project using GeoTrellis, so looking to merge ASAp",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,@rahulpalamuttam here_„Žs the link to a potentially good test file: s3://nasanex/NEX-DCP30/BCSD/rcp60/mon/atmos/tasmax/r1i1p1/v1.0/CONUS/tasmax_amon_BCSD_rcp60_r1i1p1_CONUS_bcc-csm1-1_207601-208012.nc,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,which is 1.3 G on disk downloaded,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,converting to uncompressed GeoTIFF now to see how large it would be in memory. I_„Žm thinking pretty big based on how slow GDAL is doing it,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,4.9 gigs uncompressed GeoTIFF,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,so that_„Žs what it_„Žs going to look like in memory really. except it looks like you_„Žll be converting to double,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,which will increase the byte width of the tile by 2,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,it_„Žs Float32 data,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,we could filter that data on load if that_„Žs too big,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,perhaps cut it down to a quarter of that size,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"or take the top quarter and the bottom quarter, cache, and then start the timing from there. do a local add on it, and then see how that timing works. Perhaps commit the code to github so we can test it on eachothers machines so taht it_„Žs running in teh same dev environment",7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,so this file is one variable right?,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,also how do u download it?,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,i don't use s3 that much,7/30/15,1
hectcastro,rahulpalamuttam: s3cmd or the AWS CLI should do it: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/cp.html,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,i get an unable to locate credentials,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,"aws s3 cp s3://nasanex/NEX-DCP30/BCSD/rcp60/mon/atmos/tasmax/r1i1p1/v1.0/CONUS/tasmax_amon_BCSD_rcp60_r1i1p1_CONUS_bcc-csm1-1_207601-208012.nc .Unable to locate credentialsCompleted 1 part(s) with ... file(s) remaining",7/30/15,1
hectcastro,You may need a set a valid AWS API credentials to pull it down. You can wire that up with an interactive `aws configure` once you have them.,7/30/15,1
zifeo,"@lossyrob almost done, I need to implement the safe method before. WIP is just to be able to show you the code as it is written, the commit will be cancelled at the end :)",7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,aww no i thought s3 was a free service,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,as in I won't have to put in my card details,7/30/15,1

rahulpalamuttam,awesome thank you @hectcastro ,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,hey im running my program to read the tasmax variable into a breeze array,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,the java footprint ..... is far worse than i expected,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,the array is 7025 * 3015,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,so on my node,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,it takes 3 minutes,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,to extract the data from the file,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,and reformat it into a 2 dimensional breeze array,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,don't know what kind of speedups you would be seeing,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,the node has 258 gb mem - 32 cores etc. - but it only uses 1 core for the majority of the operation,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,here's the main file https://github.com/rahulpalamuttam/SciSparkTestExperiments/blob/1.3performance/src/main/scala/org/dia/Main.scala,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,there's something off,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,3 minutes is kind of ridiculous,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,@zifeo could the `safe` methods be implemented in a separate PR?,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"@rahulpalamuttam  `7025 * 3015` is just one of the tiles. There_„Žs 60 _„ñbands_„ in that netCDF, so should be `7025 * 3015 * 6` values",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,looks like it took about 45 s to read it into an RDD and count the elements,7/30/15,1
echeipesh,Using gdal bindings ?,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,oh okay u refer to bands as the different variables,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,tasmax is one,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,then theirs lat lon,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,no their all tasmax,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,@echeipesh yes,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"so if you look into the tasmax variable, that should have 60 different entries (bands) that are `7025 * 3015`",7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,oh interesting,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,when i use the netcdf api to list the variables,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,this is all i see,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,"List(tasmax, time_bnds, lat_bnds, lon_bnds, time, lat, lon)",7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,oh never mind,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,haha,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,i got it,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,when i took the dimensions,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,of tasmax,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,wow okay,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,7k * 3k * 60 is what im reading in,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,yeah,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,okay so the majority of the time is spent reading in the array on my end,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,using the netcdf api,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,you use gdals?,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,also are u on ssds?,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,and how do you manage the huge memory footprint - for some reason I need 30gb + to read it in,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"hmm, not sure, I_„Žve bumped up my heap space to 5G",7/30/15,1
lossyrob,but I_„Žm on a laptop,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,I think this here thing has an SSD,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"working to get some code to show, probably ~ 10 min",7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,5g is reasonable,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,i first get an array in netcdf's python format,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,then copy that to a 1d java array,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,and that's what i return,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,at most i copy the data three times,7/30/15,1

lossyrob,and mess with the partitions. though max is 60,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,well actually no. I_„Žm chunking it into 256x256,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,forgot I did that. so you could repartition to a lot,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,but I mean most of the time is the initial read,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,but you could certainly get the computation time down,7/30/15,1
lossyrob,"I gotta head out, so I_„Žll be offline for a bit, back on later",7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,okay cool - still is that min and max value of the entire 7k x 3k x 60?,7/30/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,hmm mine took twice as long,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,i guess it makes sense since im using doubles not ints,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,and the load probably makes sense too since im again copying doubles,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,yeah,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,that timing includes loading,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,your min max find took 160 seconds after loading or with loading/,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,?,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"@rahulpalamuttam have you thought about using Space Filling Curves with your multidimensional approach? If so, this might be a useful conversation to read through: https://github.com/geotrellis/curve/issues/3",7/31/15,1

rahulpalamuttam,41 billion points?,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,oh no did my math wrong,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,u chuked the 7k x 6k x 60 by 256 x 25,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,*256 x 256,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,I think they spacetimekey approach works beautifully - but I wonder if there's a way to do this with an n-key,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,we tried to make it generic enough to pave the way for new key types,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"the key mechanism is a bit subtle, really relies on type classes",7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"but the thought was, one day we_„Žre going to want to do N-Dimensional work, and we tried to code towards that",7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"so most of our operations take a SpatialComponent[K] of a key, which is a typeclass that means the key type can expose a spatial component",7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"but there_„Žs no actual type heirarchy on the Key types, it_„Žs just generic",7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,oh there's no heirarchy for the key types? that's very interesting,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,how that will actually play out and look once we try to lean on it for N-Dimensional support_„_I guess we_„Žd have to try to find out,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"Yeah, so you can define custom key types",7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"but then you_„Žll need all the type classes that go into supporting key types as far as writing them to storage backends, etc, via type classes",7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"so adding a new key type is a bit of work, and we only have two (well really three, but only two supported for IO) right now",7/31/15,1
lossyrob,are you thinking of a generic N-Dimensional key type? or would there be some concrete classes?,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"We_„Žve been thinking of them as case classes, sort of like TupleN",7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,a generic N-dimensional key,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,I_„Žd have to think that one out,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,which we can split the tensor by,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,and de-compose into subtensors,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,I_„Žm not familiar with the tensor language,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,which I feel like I should be,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,sorry im not a math person myself - i just use the word tensor instead of n-dimensional array,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,i mean im pretty sure im abusing the term :),7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"ok, gotcha. would the tensor represent points in N-D space, or the whole cell? That_„Žs one thing we_„Žve been thinking about",7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"so like, our Tiles are 2D but can be in space time, and they represent areas in 2D, but points in time",7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,points in space,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,ok,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,ur tiles are 256x256,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,like they're squares of values right?,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"yeah, they cover an area",7/31/15,1
lossyrob,where as it seems like you want N continuous point spaces,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,yes,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,that is what I want,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,i want to be able to split on the individual points ,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,numpy does this - because well numpy is awesome,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,nd4j is a new library in java/scala that does this as well,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"that_„Žs more vector-y, which we_„Žre getting into, not a lot of work is done there by us yet, to get stuff into spark, but we_„Žre in collaboration with projects like GeoWave and GeoMesa for doing vector data, which is like point data",7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"how do you mean, split on individual points?",7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,umm,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,well in numpy u can take ranges from a particular dimension,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,[1:5][4:2][3:4],7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,"lie that and you get a smaller ""frame"" of the entire grid",7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"ok, so the index space is a discrete space",7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"yeah, taking subspaces is something we do",7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"so if we have a spacetimekey raster layer, we can query Accumulo or other stores for a subspace, and then only work with that data. Which it_„Žs much better to do that on load",7/31/15,1
lossyrob,and that_„Žs where that spatial indexing stuff comes in,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,gotcha,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,right it makes sense that you're able to do it,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,but to extend that,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"so, what does the index in the array mean if your dealing with point data?",7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,so the dimensions have labels,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,lattitude,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,longitude,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,because an index in our sense means a specific point in 2D,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,height,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,yea,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,ok. yeah it_„Žs hard to switch my brain into that mode,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,exacly and u can extend it to a ND point is what we want to be able to use,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"so the array index is really just _„ñPoint 1_„, _„ñPoint 2""",7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"and that point can have a set of vars, like lat lng time etc",7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,yea,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"So how my brain wanst to represent that is the actual key is the lat, lng, time, etc_„_and then the value is the actually interesting values, like the dependent vars",7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,^^ yup that's what I wanted to do as well,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,gotcha,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,but then we get to the whole data locality and performance thing,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"yeah. Right now we just work with Tiles as the _„ñvalue_„ portion, but we need to extend that for some vector (geometry) work",7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,yup that's where we're at right now as well,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,well we've extended it to the n-d case,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"if you index the keys right, you can achieve data locality on systems like accumulo",7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,so right now we don't have a key per-say,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,basically we naively load in an arbitrary array,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,and use the netcdf library to figure out the dimensions,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,i guess u could say our key is our file-name - which differs by time,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"hmm, right",7/31/15,1
lossyrob,is the code you_„Žre talking about all here? https://github.com/rahulpalamuttam/SciSparkTestExperiments,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,yea its all there in netcdfutils and netcdfloaders,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,cool. so the value is a N-D array,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,yea,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,breeze only supports 2d arrays,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"I think, if you_„Žre loading an entire file into one value",7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,theyr'e small files right now,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"if it_„Žs a lot of dimensions, your values will be very large",7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,as u saw by the link,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,gotcha,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,yea,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,they will be,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,so right now,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,we're handling the simple parallel case,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,of a large number of small files,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,are you doing any reduce actions?,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,or cross file operations?,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,so aggregating array values?,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,yeah,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,we do,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,but i haven't thoroughly tested that yet,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,infact i really need to get to testing performance of the computation in a distributed pipeline,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,like a heavy amount of matrices - not just a small batch,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"what sort of aggregation? I_„Žm trying to think it through because all the vars are packed in array values, how do you match on them?",7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,we have a dictionary,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,"so our version of the ""tile"" is really just a hashmap",7/31/15,1
lossyrob,is the aggregation code up?,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,code up?,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,like on github,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,so I can take a look,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,usually reading code answers questions pretty fast :),7/31/15,1
lossyrob,if you could point me at the aggregation operation I_„Žd get a sense,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,i dont think i have the sum of all matrix ops up on there yet,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,theirs a simple one in my main,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,ok I see the hashmap in the sRDD,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,its not the sum,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,yea,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,sRDD is a bunch of these tiles,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,hmm yeah hashmaps are a bit of a performance kill...,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,the tile could be many variables,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,yea it is,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,the variables themselves have the array behind them,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,right. and the RDD converts them to a hashmap of values,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,and the array could have coordinates lat/lon/height etc,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,so remember we talked about keys,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,whats the hashmap keys?,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,the var name?,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,the varname,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,yes,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,"but all variables are different ""values"" in one tile",7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,ugh,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,sorry im getting my terms mixed,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,sRDD is a collection of tiles,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,a tile is a bundle of variables - the variable could be rainfall/temp/etc.,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,I_„Žm having a bit of trouble reading the tensor -> hash map -> sciTensor -> T conversion,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,so is the sRDD supposed to be an RDD of sciTensors?,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,yes,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,`class sRDD[T: ClassTag <: sciTensor]`,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,ya,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,or is it `class sRDD[T <: sciTensor : ClassTag]`. I forget the order,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"and a sciTensor is really just one of these Maps, with the keys being the var names like lat, lng, tmp, and the values are a set of values that belonged to that file",7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,yea,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,awesome that's that,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,nice,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"hmm yeah. So I_„Žd almost htink you_„Žd want an RDD[(String, Double)], with each var name being the key and Double being the value, no? what_„Žs the reason for keeping the hashmap grouping?",7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,the variables themselves are the n-d array,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,the hasmap,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,is,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,"(string, ndarray)",7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,the variables themselves are they arrays,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,but I thought each var was one dimensions of the N dimensions?,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"so if _„ñlat_„, _„ñlng_„, _„ñtmp_„ are the vars, I was imagining that that was 3-D space, and each dimension was one of the vars",7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,lat lng are not vars,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,tmp is,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,lat long height are usually coordinates,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,what would multiple dimensions of tmp mean?,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,tmp is a variable,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,like rainfall,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,right. but that_„Žs 1-D,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,or humidity,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"if the element is a tensor, or to think of it as the underlying hashmap,  the wouldn_„Žt the hashmap be ( _„ñtmp_„ -> Array[Double(_„_), _„ñlat_„ -> Array[Double(_„_), etc)",7/31/15,1
lossyrob,like what does the shape of the Tensor mean?,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,one sec sorry gotta take,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,a call,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,no prob,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"I mean, reading the code I can see that each var can represent a N-D space, where we_„Žve been talking about _„ñlat_„, _„ñlng_„, and _„ñtmp_„_„_I guess an example of a var that has a dimension greater than 1 would help",7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,take tasmax for example,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"well I guess thinking about the NEX data, the tmp values were actually 3 dimensions, and those were the cell values",7/31/15,1
lossyrob,and time,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,yea,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,ok. I guess I_„Žm getting tripped up on _„ñlat_„ nad _„ñlng_„ being vars,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,yea,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,there u go,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,lat lon are usually dimensions,7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,and height,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"so inside of a var, there would be a 3 dimensional space, lat, lng, and height values",7/31/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,could be,7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"so really, our key refers to a tile layout col row, and it_„Žs not until you get into the pixel value of a tile that you get the point value. Though the time value is encoded in the key, whihc would be a dimension of the var",7/31/15,1
lossyrob,"So tiles can be thought of as chunks of values, with subspaces in a 2D plane, and the keys say what subspace that 2D plane represents, and also the location of the values in the rest of the n-D space (which for us is just 3D time)",7/31/15,1

echeipesh,In order to have neat representation of the key indexies `ZSpaceTimeKeyIndex` needs to lose it_„Žs `DateTime => Int` signature. The motivation is to give enough information to reconsturct the index without using object/function serealization. All other index methods are already well behaved.,8/7/15,1
echeipesh,"One option that comes to mind is to construct a `Vector[(DateTime, Int)]` that would map date ranges to index space by specifying breaks. The index mappings don_„Žt need to be continous so this would encoud fairly abritrary schemes.",8/7/15,1
lossyrob,"@qweqweq yes you could ingest a tif file and convert to PNG. @zifeo is working with an example of the chatta demo that works with spark, so soon we_„Žll have an example of that",8/7/15,1
lossyrob,"@echeipesh the one option was to have users define their `DateTime => Int` functions explicitly in a type, and then that type would be encoded. Is this not possible because of lack of auto-scheme generation?",8/7/15,1
echeipesh,"Actually yes, we can still do that and lean on java reflection. That_„Žs a better option",8/7/15,1
lossyrob,"Cool. I think if we supply a lot of default time indicies, the time when a user would have to make their own would be minimized",8/7/15,1

lossyrob,Hmm yeah that_„Žs true,8/7/15,1
lossyrob,"Honestly, if we move to hilbert with a temporal resolution instead of a `DateTime => Int` mapping function, then that will be more readable outside of jvm",8/7/15,1
pomadchin,"@lossyrob as I remember, now it is possible make index by pattern for time, you want more specific?",8/7/15,1
lossyrob,"no, we_„Žre trying to support that for Z indexes, but we are changing our serialization mechanism",8/7/15,1
lossyrob,"since we were leaning on Kryo, which was a bad decision (by me) for doing storage serialization",8/7/15,1
lossyrob,"so now we_„Žre switching to Avro (thanks to Eugene), and so we_„Žre trying to think about how we can support the mapping of times to ints in the Avro way of serializing",8/7/15,1
echeipesh,"Right, so if you have a crazy function right now, you_„Žd have to subclass some trait, like `DateTimeMapper` and provide that, rather than a closure. What do you think about that?",8/7/15,1
pomadchin,:d not a closure haha; but ok workaround ,8/7/15,1
lossyrob,"but also, with the hilbert curve, there_„Žs no concept of mapping date times to integers really, it_„Žs just a matter of having a temporal resolution (at `2^k` for some `k`) that divides up the temporal dimension just like there_„Žs some spatial resolution (`2^n` for some `n`).

allixender,"Hey @echeipesh @lossyrob A question regarding spark partitioning within GeoTrellis: Would it be the developers own responsibility to use spark methods like mapPartition(numPartitions: int) to force spreading out out on different spark workers? A nifty little detail in the Cassandra Spark Connector logic will on an intial loading only parallelize into the number of partitions as based on cassandra nodes/partitions. I came across that when I was doing some other spark processing with data out of a single cassandra node: The RDD would only occupy one worker even with the use of mapPartition ..., although I had more, and at first I couldn't figure why, it turns out the Cassandra Spark Connector only loaded the the data into one RDD with one partition. But with repartition(numPartitions: int) and then mapPartition(numPartitions: int) it was successfully spread onto the available workers. ",8/23/15,1
allixender,"I couldn't really verify reproduce this behaviour with GeoTrellis and Cassandra, but I often had the feeling most work was actually done in the driver program?",8/23/15,1
lossyrob,"@allixender the number of partitions is determined by the way the RDD is loaded. For example, in Accumulo, we have it so that there is one partition per tablet server, which there may be a few on each node in the cluster. So that takes care of initial partitioning. You can `repartition` or `partitionBy` in order to change that partitioning scheme later on. HDFS partitiones by, one per MapFile, which we set as max the size of one block. S3 is partitioned based on a even distribution algorithm against the filenames. I_„Žm not sure how the Cassandra connector does the partitioning",8/24/15,1
lossyrob,but `mapPartitions` is not a method that forces spreading out of data on different spark workers.,8/24/15,1
lossyrob,If you look at the code for `map`: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/rdd/RDD.scala#L313,8/24/15,1
lossyrob,"You_„Žll see that it falls through to a call to mapPartitions. mapPartitions is simple the way that a Map transformations works over one partition, which is how transformations always happen_„_transformations are represented in Tasks, and each Task works over one partition. That work is done on the owrker node.",8/24/15,1
lossyrob,"If the Cassandra Spark Connector is only loading the data into an RDD with one partition, and that partition is large (as in your loading the whole layer), then that could certainly be a problem. I am curious about how the Cassandra connector does it_„Žs partitioning. But I was under the impression that it created a partition at least per node in the cluster, where the Task is shipped to a partition where all the data of that partition lives on the node that is processing the Task.",8/24/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,hi @lossyrob  - I was curious about how geotrellis indexes the tiles?,8/24/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,i.e. do you throw index the tile by key and throw the tuple into accumolo?,8/24/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,or do you do any sort of spatial partitioning?,8/24/15,1
lossyrob,"yes, index on the key, and then the key is used as the index in accumulo as part of the id",8/24/15,1
lossyrob,we use space filling curves to indedx,8/24/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,i remember talking with you about space filling curves,8/24/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,what exactly are they?,8/24/15,1

rahulpalamuttam,thanks! I was just wondering why space curves vs kbd tree - would love to hear others opinions,8/24/15,1
moradology,it's my understanding that any space filling curve can be represented by a tree,8/24/15,1
lossyrob,"maintaining a tree isn_„Žt scalable, where SFC is just maths",8/24/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,i see,8/24/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,i see so a space filling curve can essentially be a function and indices can be quickly computed by the function,8/24/15,1
moradology,"yeah, and because it's just a function for describing arbitrarily large indexes",8/24/15,1
moradology,expanding the index size is not terribly difficult,8/24/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,interesting - so the search for a tile can effectively be O(1)?,8/24/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,"or is computing a key O(1), and finding that key a different operation all together",8/24/15,1
moradology,yeah,8/24/15,1
moradology,the latter,8/24/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,i see,8/24/15,1

moradology,so there's slight overhead,8/24/15,1
moradology,"but the actual key lookup, yes",8/24/15,1

lossyrob,"SFCs can do that, that_„Žs what the code in the geotrellis.spark.io.index does",8/24/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,very cool,8/24/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,do you think this can be extended to the n-dimensional case. I'm talking about it from a purely generic usecase,8/24/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,anyway so here's what I see as the geo-trellis pipeline for a tile-get,8/24/15,1
lossyrob,yes SFCs are N-Dimensional,8/24/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,right - just is it feasible to extend them to the N-Dimensional case. I guess I'm not sure where the one dimensional array lives - is it an RDD?,8/24/15,1
rahulpalamuttam,"from the user ""querying"" for a (time, lat, lon). Your SFC computes the linear index. Now where does it get that tile from?",8/24/15,1
lossyrob,"it doesn_„Žt live anywhere, it_„Žs just the subdomain of the function that is the SFC",8/24/15,1
lossyrob,"index from something like (I, I, R) -> I",8/24/15,1
allixender,"@lossyrob thanks for the info the spark partitioning. AFAIK Spark Cassandra Connector creates a partition per Cassandra node, the connector is quite aware of the topology of the cassandra cluster. The situation I had, was, that I had one cassandra instance on my laptop and a local spark cluster with several cores assigned to my spark worker (but also tried with two spark workers to see it more obvious), and the computation would only occupy one CPU core. it would fire on 25%. Because the cassandra RDD was only one partition. After I explicitly 'repartioned' then I saw, that spark would occupy the available cores.",8/25/15,1
allixender,"So I did a 'repartion(4)' and then enclosed my computation in a 'mapPartition(4)' to be more explicit. I guess my point is, if you have more spark workers with more cores available than Cassandra nodes, a 'repartition' might be useful. As this will incur a shuffle, I am not sure how big the performance impact would be. So I think the behaviour is similar as with the Accumulo tablet servers, but there will be certainly only one cassandra instance per cluster node. But your idea is to have the spark workers on the same nodes as e.g. the Accumulo tablet servers, or alternatively the Cassandra nodes?",8/25/15,1

moradology,"sorry i didn't respond to you when you were around, @isaacsanders, but the querying stuff within geotrellis is all ported from JTS",8/27/15,1
moradology,"worth noting, however, is that if you wanted to roll your own wrappers for JTS methods (a process that is slowly but surely being done by the GT team), there's an element of 'buyer beware' to consider: namely, that not all of these algorithms will work in the distributed, spark context",8/27/15,1
moradology,JTS stands for Java Topology Suite - i realize that wasn't 100% clear,8/27/15,1
moradology,"Here is some exemplary (hopefully relevant) JTS wrapping, if you were curious: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/vector/src/main/scala/geotrellis/vector/Polygon.scala",8/27/15,1
isaacsanders,Thanks!,8/27/15,1
moradology,"absolutely, hope that helps",8/27/15,1
isaacsanders,"And yes, @moradology, I am looking for a point and radius query.",8/27/15,1
isaacsanders,like for determining neighborhoods in flocking behavior: http://cmuems.com/2012/c/files/2012/10/boids-rules2.png,8/27/15,1
isaacsanders,for example^,8/27/15,1
moradology,mmm,8/27/15,1
moradology,there isn't something *quite* like that implemented,8/27/15,1
moradology,it could currently be fudged with something like: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/4c3c4d48540aff6bd8c7be4c8da53cc864ca76f3/testkit/src/main/scala/geotrellis/testkit/vector/GeometryBuilder.scala,8/27/15,1

moradology,and then call a within query,8/27/15,1
moradology,"not ideal, i grant you, but workable perhaps",8/27/15,1
moradology,and thanks for reaching out,8/27/15,1
isaacsanders,"Happy to do so. Is there any way I can help out? I am fairly new to scala and spark, but I figure if I will be working in this for the next 6 months or so, I should find a way to learn more idiomatic ways of doing things.",8/27/15,1
moradology,"the silver lining on that little hack is that if you have a consistent radius that you're wanting to query within (as I assume is the case for analyzing flocking behavior), you can just call setCenter on that circle instead of creating one, ad hoc, when needed",8/27/15,1
moradology,fantastic question - i'm pretty certain your assistance would be appreciated but the two people most capable of talking to you about details on that aren't around today,8/27/15,1

pomadchin,"@lossyrob @echeipesh and one more tip; for example got two chunks of files to load, as a map via ingest (10000 files & 10000 files _„î load them chunked); but as we can se, there would be an error, caused by rewriteing overlapping areas",8/27/15,1
pomadchin,"how it is possible to ingest them correctly as a map, chunked, not all tiles as one batch?",8/27/15,1
pomadchin,"I see it like a special ingest, which tries to retry tms square and to merge em (new with old)",8/27/15,1
echeipesh,"@pomadchin Yes, that_„Žs a hole in the ingest right now. I think most general way to handle this case would be to have a `RasterRDD.merge` similar to the way we have `Tile.merge` ( that is used by Tiler). Then you could load an RDD of existing tiles and merge it with freshly ingested tiles before saving the result. That makes it a mini-batch process in a sense. There may even be some prototype code for that.If you_„Žre super worried about the speed of ingest/merge it is possible to implement tile merge as an accumulo iterator (combiner). In that case writing to a table with the same layer name would be an _„ñupdate_„ done during accumulo compaction (before next read). Of course that is much more specific and fragile solution.",8/31/15,1
pomadchin,"@echeipesh I've implemented 'by tile' just to check out out, but found troubles at some zoom levels ",8/31/15,1
echeipesh,What do you mean by tile ?,8/31/15,1
pomadchin,"I am taking the keys of current input, and getting tiles (by key) for a certain zoom ",8/31/15,1

lossyrob,"@pomadchin Eugene was talking about having update functionality in GT, and that you_„Žd need that. Would you need to update certain tiles directly, or need to read the tiles from the layer, use it to derive the new tile, and then save it off? Do you need to add new tiles to the layer? We haven_„Žt worked out the update story, so I_„Žm looking for ideas on what we_„Žd have to cover for it.",9/1/15,1
lossyrob,"@isaacsanders your use case sounds very interesting, I_„Žve been out but it would be great to discuss it some more.",9/1/15,1
pomadchin,@lossyrob seems to me that it would be nice to update by one tile and by some bulk insert,9/1/15,1
pomadchin,this would be great to update layers in a such way,9/1/15,1
pomadchin,"although, I thought about ingesting cloud tiles, but making them cloudless during the ingest, basing on an information layer (LANDSAT BQE, for example)",9/1/15,1
pomadchin,"so it doen_„Žt mean only cloudless, it is just a use case example)",9/1/15,1
lossyrob,"So as new imagery comes in, not to mosaic those images, but to replace imagery in a layer (overwrite) and possible add new tiles (and change the metadata)",9/1/15,1
pomadchin,yes,9/1/15,1
lossyrob,"Right now the thought is that we_„Žd have independent writer classes for doing RDD writes, whether they be MultiBandTiles or Tiles. I_„Žm wondering if the update belongs there or in a separate process, where those classes can share funcitonality",9/1/15,1
lossyrob,"I think creating some spike code that would successfully update a layer and it_„Žs metadata for one of the backends, like accumulo or s3, would be a good first step.",9/1/15,1
lossyrob,@hectcastro @echeipesh so are we now able to pull down binaries from bin tray?,9/2/15,1

lossyrob,very cool.https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/pull/1167,9/2/15,1
lossyrob,"so we_„Žre going to modify the travis build to always push out a bintray binary for pushes to master, yeah?",9/2/15,1
pomadchin,"wow nice idea :D %) I had to publish on bintray some my fixes for an old gt, in order not to build gt every time on a new machine / docker",9/2/15,1
lossyrob,Nice. This should make it a lot easier for people to use new functionality.,9/2/15,1
hectcastro,"lossyrob: Yeah. Once that PR goes in, I'll work on setting up the automatic publishing.",9/2/15,1
lossyrob,@echeipesh maybe better to talk it out here. So what_„Žs with the move from `Build.scala` to `build.sbt`? Is that the new build file format you were mentioning?,9/2/15,1
echeipesh,"yup, that_„Žs the new _„ñrecommended standard_„, it_„Žs less restrictive than old sbt and less scary than Build.scala.",9/2/15,1
echeipesh,http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/tutorial/Basic-Def.html,9/2/15,1
lossyrob,So there_„Žs some sort of import magic that imports things like `Version.scala` into the file automatically?,9/2/15,1
echeipesh,There is some of that going on. All objects in `project/` are available and I noticed less imports for plugins are required.,9/2/15,1
echeipesh,"Hector pointed out that a lot of the examples in the wild deal with `build.sbt` and not `Build.scala`, which makes it more familiar to people reading it.",9/2/15,1
lossyrob,Let me read up on it a bit,9/2/15,1
echeipesh,"It_„Žs a little bit of situation of when SBT says jump, you say how high moment. But I like this format.",9/2/15,1
echeipesh,"Yep, if you find a reason not to use it, we can just c/p the body back into a Build class.",9/2/15,1
lossyrob,"Whichever way we go, we should do all-or-nothing on subproject build.sbt_„Žs. We used to have those, and it lost me an hour or so trying to figure out why a build was happening in the way that it was.",9/2/15,1
lossyrob,"But yeah. If that_„Žs the recommended way of doing it, I just hope there_„Žs not a thing where it won_„Žt support it or SBT_„Žs magic won_„Žt be weird and we won_„Žt be able to scala our way out of it. But I see the appeal.",9/2/15,1
echeipesh,"Ok, let me throw out an alternative: main `build.sbt` contains the dependencies and project links, and subproject `build.sbt`s contain stuff like compiler flags and assembly settings. Do you think this is _„ñmodulerazation_„ or _„ñfragmentation_„?",9/2/15,1
echeipesh,"The escape hatch seems to be if you need scala your way out, you just put it in `project/` class and do whatever the hell you want there, then just use it.",9/2/15,1
lossyrob,"I feel like it_„Žs fragmentation, but that_„Žs because I_„Žve been burned by it before. It was messy though, subproject build.sbt_„Žs had random stuff and not in a coherent way. I think if we created rules it might be better, but also could easily slip out of coherence. @hectcastro or others have any input on this?",9/2/15,1
hectcastro,would be useful down the road as well.,9/2/15,1
hectcastro,"I'm not an expert on the new format, and don't have much experience with the old approaches either, but constraining open ended Scala in the build definition seems like a good way forward. Harnessing the new format appropriately to take advantage of separating out all of the details of each subproject build instead of having everything in one seems like it",9/2/15,1
lossyrob,"Subproject build.sbt_„Žs aren_„Žt a new thing, that was around before (and part of an old version of GeoTrellis). Is the `/project` scala files available inside the subproject `build.sbt` files? If not, then that_„Žs not good, because depending on whether or not some build setting needs e.g. a Version",9/2/15,1
lossyrob,it would go in the main `build.sbt` or the subproject `build.sbt`,9/2/15,1
lossyrob,looks like the subproject does get those,9/2/15,1

echeipesh,"I_„Žve spent some more time trying to get the original form with no solution, so I_„Žm sticking with what I showed you yesterday: `new S3RDDReader[SpatialKey, Tile, RasterRDD]` and `new S3RDDWriter[SpatialKey, Tile, RasterRDD]`.

nicerobot,"@timothymschier @lossyrob Sorry, i'm a little late to the GeoWave conversation but we did look into GeoWave and decided that they are a little behind GeoMesa for our use-case though I haven't gotten the details on that evaluation yet. That said, it also seems we've gotten an indication from GeoWave that they are in talks with GeoMesa to merge.",9/21/15,1
lossyrob,Thanks @nicerobot. I_„Žd be curious to see what the features were in GeoMesa that were ahead of GeoWave on once those details are around,9/21/15,1
pomadchin,@lossyrob @echeipesh what about rdd merge method? got any ideas about it and how it would be working?,9/21/15,1
lossyrob,hey @pomadchin ,9/21/15,1
lossyrob,yeah we had discussed some strategies. Are you thinking of trying to work on it?,9/21/15,1
echeipesh,There is a trivial and case that I started some work to support (where you_„Žre updating two layers only) https://github.com/echeipesh/geotrellis/blob/feature/catalog-splitup-2/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/mosaic/RddMergeMethods.scala,9/21/15,1
echeipesh,"There is a non-trivial case where you_„Žre updating more than two RDDs and you need to keep track of z-order per pixel, @lossyrob ran into that one.",9/21/15,1
nicerobot,"@lossyrob I got some feedback about the evaluation and it's less about technical capabilities. 1) We're focusing on Scala so like that GM is Scala. 2) We need to customize our keys and we didn't _notice_ a way to control the keys in GW. 3) The community was really quiet, making it seem GM is better supported. 4) the GW docs didn't seem as thorough.",9/21/15,1
lossyrob,@nicerobot that_„Žs good info. @rfecher would probably appreciate that feedback,9/21/15,1
pomadchin,@echeipesh nice tip will try top check it,9/21/15,1
echeipesh,What are you exactly trying to do? I_„Žm more than willing to talk it out with you and maybe help a PR form : ),9/21/15,1
pomadchin,"(: it anupdate ingest, which can be just mosaic or can update and overwrite already ingested data",9/21/15,1
echeipesh,Is a new pixel always overwriting old pixel?,9/21/15,1
pomadchin,"if it is valuable, yes;",9/21/15,1
echeipesh,"If it_„Žs availble, so your new tiles could contain _„ñNoData_„ values.",9/21/15,1
pomadchin,"yep, so the valuable data can have intersections with already ingested",9/21/15,1
pomadchin,"In terms of the current merge tiles function, just to add else branch (in the mosaic package)",9/21/15,1
echeipesh,"So the basic process that minizmes pain is probably:1. Get some data that_„Žs an update2. Query the layer for extent covering update tiles (you_„Žll know this after mosaiking the update)3. Merge update into the existing tiles (the above merge method should work, but needs better testing)4. Write update tiles while adjusting the raster metadata in the AttributeStore",9/21/15,1
echeipesh,"Ah, that_„Žs right, we don_„Žt check if the source of pixels is no data, that_„Žs an oversight.",9/21/15,1
echeipesh,The `RasterMetaData` class will just need a `combine` method that can be called from the catalog on an update. That should cover it actually.,9/21/15,1
pomadchin,"hm, and how to query the old data? Need to pass the second rdd inside Pyramid.up function?",9/21/15,1
echeipesh,"No, I think it should live outside of Pyramid. Perhaps Pyramid.up should return `Seq[Int, RDD[(K, TileType)]` so you could just walk over it and query some catalog independently.",9/21/15,1
echeipesh,Maybe there can be an `UpdatingPyraimd` layer that automates the process given `FilteringRasterRDDReader` instance.,9/21/15,1
pomadchin,understood,9/21/15,1
echeipesh,Pyramiding is kind of strange that way. Is your base layer always a source of truth and you can merge at the base and pyramid up. Is every level a layer in its own right? I_„Žm not sure what is the _„ñcorrect_„ answer there.,9/21/15,1
echeipesh,"Ah yes, there is correct answer, you have to do it per level. The base level tiles will not cover all the tiles in the upper levels, you will always need more to pad as you zoom out.",9/21/15,1
pomadchin,Yes _»´ ,9/21/15,1
echeipesh,"Also good news about Pyramid.up is that since it_„Žs a non-forking process it can safely return the sequence of RDDs without causing any collections. You would have to iterate it in the right direction though, to take advantage of the shuffle caching.",9/21/15,1

rfecher,"@nicerobot @timothymschier getting back to the GW/GM evaluation (sorry I'm a couple days behind on it)...it sounds like you've made your decision but if you do end up looking back at GW, definitely hit up the gitter or the mailing list to ask the question regarding controlling your keys, I'm curious what your use case is to give you the most accurate answer, but generally you can implement your own index strategy at a  higher level: https://github.com/ngageoint/geowave/blob/master/core/index/src/main/java/mil/nga/giat/geowave/core/index/NumericIndexStrategy.java or at a lower level you can implement your own space filling curve which is what the default numeric index strategy will use (and the default index strategy's default sfc is the compact hilbert implementation that geotrellis has also been looking at): https://github.com/ngageoint/geowave/blob/master/core/index/src/main/java/mil/nga/giat/geowave/core/index/sfc/SpaceFillingCurve.java",9/23/15,1
rfecher,"also we'll have to look more at documentation, we have this page for reference documentation that we felt was pretty thorough, but what we feel we're lacking is in blogging about use cases - our plan is to write some more blog-style rather than reference material and perhaps complement the blogs with a tech talk in the form of a hangout or something like that",9/23/15,1
rfecher,http://ngageoint.github.io/geowave/documentation.html,9/23/15,1
rfecher,"but please feedback any particulars about documentation that you'd like to address, and we will try to address it",9/23/15,1
rfecher,"oh and re: gw/gm merge, *both* projects think its in the best interest of the community to get on the same page and we know there's a lot of overlap...but the nature of these discussions is *not* a merge of gw into gm, which maybe I read out of context but it seemed may have been your take away @nicerobot ",9/23/15,1
nicerobot,"@rfecher Thanks. I'll pass that index strategy to the dev. We really like Scala which make GeoTrellis and GeoMesa attractive but, of course, solutions come before tech-preferences so if we can get more done faster with GW we might use it instead.Re: our use-case. big-picture: points, polygons, and rasters. and, as probably typical of this field, any combinations (utilizing mostly proprietary algorithms) of any of those elements (including results of analysis) can be utilized for analysis. ""standard"" keys facilitate that typical use-case. we additionally utilize a means of relating rasters and polygons depending on how they are created/related so that is the part where we customize the keys. If i'm being too vague, i may be able to think of a practical example.Re: merge. I wasn't thinking merging one _into_ the other but hoping we'd end up with one project that utilized aspects from both. One of the big problems I see is that these stacks aren't trivial so evaluation itself is an investment. It's partly why community response, documentation, and project activity is important to us.Re: docs. I think the main thing about the docs was figuring out the indexing. With your like to the code, we can probably figure it out from there.",9/23/15,1
rfecher,"@nicerobot yeah, and just to let you know I don't mean to pressure you to go one way or the other, just getting information out there...we use a concept of a dataadapter for actually persisting whatever data you may want, so we have a rasterdataadapter that allows you to work with GridCoverage (geotools' raster data model) and vectordataadapter for simplefeature (geotools' vector data model), but they can both be comingled in the same table so you can easily run analysis with rasters/points/polygons together...I think I would be interested if you have a practical example because it sounds interesting",9/23/15,1
nicerobot,"@rfecher ok.Example use-case: Simple analytics. Our rasters are ""user-defined"" but we uniquely identify each by its extent, category, and message digest of the raster data. Based on the raster id (not just the extent), and maybe more user input, we filter a subset of polygons to analyze. Using the queried set of polygons, we intersect them with rasters (maybe more than just the user-defined one) and run calculations on the values of the rasters within the polygonal intersections. Our rasters and polygons are all uniquely identifiable since we rely on those to allow users to manage and control the analysis.",9/23/15,1
lossyrob,"In GeoTrellis, we call that operation a zonal summary. Are the polygons your running against the rasters for the zonal summary large? Or would they be able to be shipped to each node and used for the calculations? We haev it set up that you pass in a Polygon or MultiPolygon to the zonal summary operation, and that will intersect the polygon(s) with each of the tiles to run the calculation ina distributed way. If the polygon(s) are very heavy or complex enough that having a distributed set of polygons would make sense, we don_„Žt yet support that",9/23/15,1
lossyrob,"That would be an interesting use case for us to attack that case for a good first pass at RDD[(SpatialKey, Polygon)] if that_„Žs needed",9/23/15,1
pomadchin,"`@offtop` guyz, the `catalog.read[K](layerId).map { case (key, tile) => key }.collect() ` array will have all the keys for layerId?",9/23/15,1
lossyrob,yessir,9/23/15,1
pomadchin,:D ty!,9/23/15,1
lossyrob,"if you raster is evenly distributed, you could derive that information fro the keyBounds, but if it_„Žs not, then yeah that_„Žs the best way to go about it",9/23/15,1
nicerobot,"I've seen some of our polygons as big as ~100M but they'll typically be far smaller, maybe between 20K and 2M. That said, even with one analytics job we can be talking about 100s of polygons so as we scale, shipping polygons can become a massive network bottleneck. I'm thinking that instead of min-squaring the polygons, we tile them the same as rasters which should provide better locality.",9/23/15,1
lossyrob,"yeah, if you could get the polygons into an RDD that was RDD[(SpatialKey, MultiPolygon)] then it would be a matter of `rasterRDD.join(multiPolygonRDD).mapValues { (tile, polygons) => _„_ }`",9/23/15,1
lossyrob,and that `_„_` would be using the `Rasterizer` to iterate over the cells covered by the polygons on that tile to do the calculation,9/23/15,1
nicerobot,Cool. Thanks. Hopefully i'll be able to give this a try within the next day or two.,9/23/15,1
lossyrob,"ok. the Rasterizer api is a bit ornery (been meaning to rewrite that for a while), so let us help you with that. I_„Žm going to be out for a while starting Friday, but @echeipesh will be able to help",9/23/15,1
rfecher,"so for us, storing features or rasters with a unique ID and being able to look them up explicitly by that ID is part of the default behavior...every data element ingested into the system has a data ID and you can retrieve by data ID here: https://github.com/ngageoint/geowave/blob/master/core/store/src/main/java/mil/nga/giat/geowave/core/store/DataStore.java#L184",9/23/15,1

anandthakker,@pomadchin cool thanks :),9/24/15,1
anandthakker,"i guess my first/main question is: i've got a pipeline using rasterio + gdal_polygonize to do some raster math and then get polygons out of it.  looking to apply it on a pretty large scale (30m raster, worldwide coverage).  do you think geotrellis can help?",9/24/15,1
echeipesh,"@anandthakker Greetings and welcome! You kind of have two options here. GeoTrellis is a scala project, you can certainly use it to do raster math and extract polygons from resulting tiles (good questions are exactly how and what happens to polygons that span tile boundaries). Second option is to just do what you_„Žre doing on top of pyspark, which is tempting since rastario is just so nice convinient. lossyrob has is currently working on a project where he has a pyspark+rasterio pre-processing step before pulling the rasters into geotrellis, that would be a good thing to look at. (let me see if I can fish that out)",9/24/15,1
anandthakker,"@echeipesh oh nice -- having not used spark myself, i'd love to see a pyspark + rasterio model!",9/24/15,1
anandthakker,"as for the polygons: because of the way i'm using them, it's not really important for them to cross tile boundaries--i.e., i'd be happy to extract polygons from within each tile",9/24/15,1
anandthakker,"i guess if rasterio can work w/ pyspark, then maybe gdal_polygonize.py can, too? ",9/24/15,1

anandthakker,"yeah, that's pretty sweet -- is it hard to get gdal properly installed & configured for the executors?",9/24/15,1
lossyrob,"Also GeoTrellis has support for doing zonal summary calculations given polygons, not sure what sort of math you_„Žre looking to do, but a more robust approach might be to ingest the rasters into a GeoTrellis catalog and go through the geotrellis spark stuff.

anandthakker,"re: zonal summaries: what i'm ultimately doing is creating a set of vector tiles, and at the highest zoom I basically want a full fidelity vector version of the raster.  (weird, i know, because this makes vectors out of individual pixels much of the time)",9/24/15,1
anandthakker,well that is just sweeet.,9/24/15,1
anandthakker,maybe i'll try to isolate that bootstrap stuff into a boilerplate repo before i add in my actual processing,9/24/15,1
lossyrob,that would be awesome,9/24/15,1
lossyrob,"oh gotcha re: vector tiles. Curious to how that works out; vector data of pixels feels like it would be pretty huge, but then again that_„Žs probably just my penchant for working with rasters ha",9/24/15,1
anandthakker,yeah it's generally pretty huge,9/24/15,1
anandthakker,heh,9/24/15,1
anandthakker,"but it actually depends: this particular (population density) has big contiguous regions w the same value, so that moderates the size quite a bit",9/24/15,1
anandthakker,"speaking purely, it would make more sense to keep this as raster data, but vector tiles are a better fit for the application in this case",9/24/15,1
anandthakker,"but also to be fair, i'm also just way more familiar with vectors, so that's probably also part of what led me to this approach",9/24/15,1
anandthakker,heh,9/24/15,1
lossyrob,you have worldwide 30m population density?,9/24/15,1
anandthakker,http://www.worldpop.org.uk/,9/24/15,1
anandthakker,"it's from a model, and it's actually South America, Africa, and Asia",9/24/15,1
anandthakker,"""worldwide"" was just shorter to say earlier :)",9/24/15,1
lossyrob,oh nice. I_„Žm working with some 30 pop density for US,9/24/15,1
lossyrob,*30m,9/24/15,1
lossyrob,"as part of a larger weighted overlay operation, including housing vacancy, NLCD, housing prices, some others",9/24/15,1
anandthakker,oh cool - is it open/available?,9/24/15,1
lossyrob,"Yeah, not sure exactly where it comes from",9/24/15,1
lossyrob,I could find out tho,9/24/15,1
anandthakker,i'd love to add it to this worldpop dataset,9/24/15,1
lossyrob,"nice. We have a data wizard at Azavea (Sarah Cordivano) who constructed it. She says: ""i downloaded population by block groups and its from ACS 2008-2013 5 year estimates. then i calculated area of every block group and divided population by area to get density.""",9/24/15,1
anandthakker,that's rad,9/24/15,1
mapadelphia,"Hi!  ""data wizard"" here. ;-) not really a wizard, more of a helpful elf",9/24/15,1
anandthakker,i saw Sarah talk about redistricting at Tcamp,9/24/15,1
mapadelphia,LMK if you have any questions about the data,9/24/15,1
anandthakker,hi @mapadelphia !,9/24/15,1
mapadelphia,oh! hi! yes i remember!,9/24/15,1
mapadelphia,"fun fact, we actually tried to do these calculations with BLOCK population",9/24/15,1
mapadelphia,and my computer exploded,9/24/15,1
anandthakker,haha,9/24/15,1
mapadelphia,not really. but it was a non-starter based on the size of the data,9/24/15,1
anandthakker,yeah i can imagine,9/24/15,1
mapadelphia,there are over 11 million us block polygons ,9/24/15,1
lossyrob,good case for getting GeoTrellis rasterization to work over a RDD[Polygon]. Ah if there was only more time in the day...,9/24/15,1
anandthakker,"yeah i was about to say, sounds like a case for spark/geotrellis!",9/24/15,1
lossyrob,but really that wouldn_„Žt be *too* hard to pull off.,9/24/15,1
anandthakker,"still, block group level detail ain't bad :)",9/24/15,1
mapadelphia,yup! we did DL all the data at block level so i do have it to share too. i can look later,9/24/15,1
lossyrob,"Yeah, that would be a good project for someone to work on for GeoTrellis. Too bad GSoC isn_„Žt until next summer.",9/24/15,1
lossyrob,Any takers in this room? ;),9/24/15,1
mapadelphia,"one thing though, not a big deal",9/24/15,1
lossyrob,How does one contrubite data to world pop?,9/24/15,1
mapadelphia,but i think the block level data is actually 2010 decennial population as opposed to 2008-2013 acs pop data,9/24/15,1
lossyrob,If I was smarter I would know what that meant lol,9/24/15,1
anandthakker,"@lossyrob i don't know if it's something they take contributions to, but we kinda know some of the researchers that run it so we could talk to them",9/24/15,1
anandthakker,or put you in touch w them,9/24/15,1
anandthakker,"@mapadelphia actually that's probably better/more consistent in my particular case, because i'm using 2010 estimates from the worldpop dataset",9/24/15,1
mapadelphia,"no worries at all. so every 10 years (decennial), the census captures a ""full"" survey of population, on the off years, they use extrapolations and sample surveys to estimate what those figures might be, this is know as the American Community Survey or (ACS) in general ACS is relatively reliable especially in urban areas, but in rural areas the margin of error is high",9/24/15,1
mapadelphia,"@anandthakker agreed, 2010 is considered by some to be more accurate, especially if comparing to other countries at the same year",9/24/15,1
lossyrob,ah I see. So the ACS is more up to date but perhaps a higher margin of error in rural areas,9/24/15,1
mapadelphia,yup,9/24/15,1
lossyrob,"@anandthakker it would be interesting to touch base with the researchers and see if they could find the data useful, or just chat about the techniques if you could make that connection",9/24/15,1
lossyrob,maybe it would give good reason to do the block polyginization in GeoTrellis and we_„Žd get to spend some time on that,9/24/15,1
anandthakker,happy to,9/24/15,1
lossyrob,thanks!,9/24/15,1
anandthakker,"i might actually have Nate do it, since he knows the worldpop folks a little better than i do",9/24/15,1
lossyrob,for sure,9/24/15,1
anandthakker,can i use the same email i already have for you?,9/24/15,1
lossyrob,"yeah that will work, and I_„Žll include @mapadelphia on it in a reply.",9/24/15,1
lossyrob,or I_„Žll just pm you her email (I don_„Žt know if there_„Žs bots scraping the pulic channels or if that_„Žs paranoia),9/24/15,1
anandthakker,surely the scraping is happening,9/24/15,1
anandthakker,good call :),9/24/15,1
lossyrob,haha,9/24/15,1
mapadelphia,":) I'm about to head out for the day, but I think I can wrangle the data tomorrow or monday and see what i can get to you, i'd also like to but a bit of documentation together to make sure we are properly detailing any processing we did",9/24/15,1
lossyrob,nice!,9/24/15,1
anandthakker,@lossyrob I realized it might be better manners to send him a private note first before sharing his email.  I'll send the intro note once i hear back,9/24/15,1
anandthakker,heh,9/24/15,1
lossyrob,"that sounds good, thanks!",9/24/15,1
anandthakker,hey quick question:,9/24/15,1
anandthakker,https://github.com/hotosm/oam-server-tiler/blob/master/add-steps.sh#L11,9/24/15,1
anandthakker,"the last argument there, `s3://workspace-oam-hotosm-org/test-req3.json` -- is that equivalent to https://github.com/hotosm/oam-server-tiler/blob/master/test-req-full.json",9/24/15,1
anandthakker,?,9/24/15,1
lossyrob,yes,9/24/15,1
lossyrob,that_„Žs the request data that the chunk.py will parse out ,9/24/15,1
anandthakker,"oh i see - it's just a string argument, nothing specialized",9/24/15,1
lossyrob,yeah totally,9/24/15,1
anandthakker,@lossyrob is the SNS stuff important?,9/24/15,1
anandthakker,in general?,9/24/15,1
lossyrob,"it_„Žs SQS stuff, do I make a mention to SNS ? I was lookign to use SNS but I switched to SQS",9/24/15,1
lossyrob,"but it_„Žs just for communication about job status, not necessary to run jobs",9/24/15,1
anandthakker,ah yeah - https://github.com/hotosm/oam-server-tiler/blob/master/chunk/chunk.py#L30,9/24/15,1
lossyrob,whoops I need to push up changes,9/24/15,1
lossyrob,just pushed up the changes,9/24/15,1
anandthakker,cool ,9/24/15,1
anandthakker,@lossyrob what's the story with the instance groups?,9/24/15,1
mojodna,@anandthakker: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticMapReduce/latest/DeveloperGuide/InstanceGroups.html,9/24/15,1
mojodna,EMR provides 3 instance groups so that you can use spot instances for extra capacity without compromising an HDFS cluster made up of core instances,9/24/15,1
mojodna,"since there_„Žs no persistent FS here, the core instances can be spot instances",9/24/15,1
anandthakker,"oh, interesting",9/24/15,1
anandthakker,Thanks @mojodna ,9/24/15,1
mojodna,np,9/24/15,1
mojodna,"actually, in the OAM case, we have 3 reserved instances, so those can make up the core and then anything else we want to throw at it can be bonus (spot instances with very low bids)",9/24/15,1
lossyrob,we can_„Žt actually,9/24/15,1
mojodna,oh?,9/24/15,1
lossyrob,because there_„Žs something weird with it trying to use the HDFS on Task instance groups,9/24/15,1
lossyrob,and it failing because they don_„Žt have Takss,9/24/15,1
mojodna,"boo, ok.",9/24/15,1
lossyrob,yeah weirdly,9/24/15,1
lossyrob,"i didn_„Žt dig too deep, but when I tried to use Task groups as spot instances that failed because of HDFS errors",9/24/15,1
anandthakker,huh.  possibly Spark doing some caching/checkpointing behind the scenes?,9/24/15,1
anandthakker,"(I'm a total spark & EMR newb, so it's possible that that sentence is total garbage. heh.)",9/24/15,1
mojodna,"if i discover anything while @lossyrob is away, i_„Žll post my findings here (and in hotosm/oam-server)",9/24/15,1
lossyrob,Spark does awesome caching/checkpointing,9/24/15,1
lossyrob,there_„Žs some _„ñcheckpointing_„ of shuffle data in shuffles between stages. Those are some heavier spark terms.,9/24/15,1
anandthakker,@lossyrob @mojodna https://github.com/developmentseed/spark-rasterio-seed,9/24/15,1
anandthakker,pulled out the tiler-specific logic to get down to a reusable boilerplate there,9/24/15,1
mojodna,"nice.  i did some chipping away at my version while on vacation_„_haven_„Žt converged it yet, but if there_„Žs anything relevant, there will be a PR headed your way",9/24/15,1
anandthakker,oh sweet,9/24/15,1
mojodna,the main thing to look out for is a `Makefile` that puts the stuff that EMR pulls out of S3 in S3 before starting the jobs,9/24/15,1
anandthakker,oh nice -- i was just thinking i should automate that.  i'll hold off if you've already got it on the way,9/24/15,1
mojodna,"not yet, but was going to write it this afternoon",9/24/15,1
lossyrob,"there_„Žs a bunch of `.sh` scripts that do those steps, I also thought of chunking them into a Makefile that calls out to the scripts as to make it clearer how to interface with it. ",9/24/15,1
lossyrob,so I_„Žll be looking for those changes :),9/24/15,1
pomadchin,"@all Guyz, are there any issues with 1.6.2 vs 1.6.3 api compatibility? mb smb knows",9/25/15,1
echeipesh,AFAIK should be no issues. Accumulo guys take version stability very seriosly.,9/25/15,1
pomadchin,I guess that issues can be only cross major version,9/25/15,1
anandthakker,@mojodna @lossyrob hey guys -- have you had any luck running a pyspark job on EMR with a script that needs a couple local imports?,9/25/15,1
anandthakker,"(the oam tiler, i saw, just references a single .py file on s3...)",9/25/15,1
mojodna,no.  i wound up propagating whatever would have been imported locally using `bootstrap.sh`,9/25/15,1
mojodna,the documentation around distributing zip files w/ local dependencies is pretty limited and i couldn_„Žt get it to work as expected,9/25/15,1
anandthakker,"ah.  that's what i was afraid of, heh.",9/25/15,1
anandthakker,i guess it'll be one big long file then :),9/25/15,1
mojodna,it might be more straightforward if you_„Žre not trying to distribute PIP deps (directory for each module),9/25/15,1
anandthakker,"eh -- this thing i'm doing is pretty quick and dirty anyway, so i'll just go with the copy-paste route for now.  ",9/25/15,1
mojodna,;-),9/25/15,1
anandthakker,i mean... it's friday afternoon,9/25/15,1
anandthakker,@mojodna okay here's one that's proving a bit of a weird doozy:  my input data for this spark job is a bunch of gzipped tiffs on s3,9/25/15,1
anandthakker,"rasterio doesn't seem to accept file contents directly (i.e., wants a file path or uri), but seems like gunzipping locally in the executor is gonna be problematic.",9/25/15,1
anandthakker,any ideas?,9/25/15,1
anandthakker,"(other than, you know, unzip it and re-upload to s3)",9/25/15,1
mojodna, `/vsicurl/vsigzip/http://s3.amazonaws.com/...` may work as an input for you,9/25/15,1
anandthakker,oh no way,9/25/15,1
mojodna,otherwise i_„Žd download it and uncompress it as part of a map task,9/25/15,1
anandthakker,"yah i figured the latter, but then i'd have the actual file bytes, which i haven't yet found a way to feed to `rasterio`",9/25/15,1
mojodna,temp files ;-),9/25/15,1
anandthakker,that's safe from within a spark job?,9/25/15,1
anandthakker,i've been assuming i should stay away from the fs...,9/25/15,1
mojodna,sure.  use `mkstemp` (https://docs.python.org/2/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.mkstemp) so temp files from different tasks running on the same instance don_„Žt collide,9/25/15,1
mojodna,"fs is safe from within an individual `map` lambda / function, but don_„Žt assume that things will be available outside of that",9/25/15,1
mojodna,"for passing data between stages, numpy arrays (which rasterio can input/output) seem to be the best bet",9/25/15,1
mojodna,"if your rasters contain NODATA values, make sure that you_„Žre using masked arrays",9/25/15,1
anandthakker,ahh okay.  i was being overly cautious about the fs thing but makes sense that it's safe within a single map fn,9/25/15,1
mojodna,"no guarantee that you won_„Žt run out of disk, but is there ever?",9/25/15,1
anandthakker,hah true,9/25/15,1
anandthakker,@mojodna any chance you're around?,9/27/15,1

echeipesh,"@dzeno, Spark is very much our primary focus right now. We are consciously choosing to make ""a good release"" rather than just _„ña release_„ so the date is slipping a bit. Having said that there is only a couple of features we are targetting that are still not worked out: good multi-band support throughout the API, that_„Žs nearly done with #1182 and RDD partitioning control through operations, next up. I would expect to go into polish and release mode by Novembers end. We are dogfooding geotrellis internally on couple of projects even as we develop it so stability (from the standpoint of not blowing up : ) is a priority. API stability will get there soon.

echeipesh,"And yes, we index tiles in all our backends (S3, HDFS, Accumulo) and then will only fetch a required bonding box back to operate on. It wasn_„Žt clear if you are talking about vector or raster data for your use case though.",9/28/15,1
echeipesh,"@pomadchin using the where on RasterRDDQuery like `new RasterRDDQuery[SpatialKey].where(Intersects(GridBounds(x, y, x, y)))` will translate the query into specific ranges in underlying index and only fetch those tiles.

echeipesh,"@pomadchin re: query restriction. Thats correct, when you do a query through the `.query` on a reader it will clip your query to stored metadata. This is because generating the query ranges and looking for them still has performance cost even if tiles are not there (some cost at least). It_„Žs a bit of an oversight that tile reader does not perform similar checks, but in that case there is no such cost since it_„Žs a direct key->value lookup.",9/28/15,1

nicerobot,Anyone have a detailed comparison on Cassandra vs Accumulo specifically regarding spatial use-cases? I liked  the GeoMesa discussion of Accumulo but I've not yet found such depth regarding Cassanda (or other options).,10/2/15,1
pomadchin,"@nicerobot we all here waiting for it, think soon gt guyz will provide us comparison tables ",10/2/15,1
dzeno,"@echeipesh Thank you for your reply! In my example I was talking about the vector data. What I would like to know if it is possible to do with geotrellis is the following: Given the point (long, lat), I would like to get all the points in some given range around it. Hope that now is more clear what I want. Thanks !",10/5/15,1
echeipesh,"@dzeno at the moment GeoTrellis is focused on the raster processing, vector processing will come later. But either GeoWave (https://ngageoint.github.io/geowave/documentation.html) or GeoMesa (http://geomesa.github.io) got your use case covered (both of them index geometries in Accumulo and support nearest neighbor queries.",10/5/15,1
echeipesh,"@nicerobot I don_„Žt know of any current project that really uses Cassandra for spatial indexing. Currently the favoriate teqnique of doing spatial queries on Accumulo relies on SFC decomposition which requires a oredered index to work well. Something different would be required for Cassandra to take advantage of scalability given by hash partitioning. SimpleGeo had a project that used unbalanced zcurve partitined R+ tree (not sure if there is a good name for that structure) that is very interesting: https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=707&v=7J61pPG9j90, http://www.slideshare.net/mmalone/working-with-dimensional-data-in-distributed-hash-tables but it_„Žs gone into the aether now.",10/5/15,1

allixender,"Hi @pomadchin, I have been keeping the Cassandra branch up  to date with master during GSoC but I got a little out of touch due to my studies... and latest GeoTrellis master progress will require also additions in the Cassandra branch",10/5/15,1

lossyrob,yeah :) been traveling Spain for a bit on vacation. ,10/19/15,1
echeipesh,"@lossyrob @pomadchin bringing a conversation in here: For layer update feature, if ther user is trying to update a layer that does not exist_„_ should the layer be created or should an error be thrown?",10/19/15,1
echeipesh,"my gut feeling is that it should be similar to SQL update, where it throws an error. But Upsert is useful API, so a little split on this issue.",10/19/15,1
lossyrob,eh,10/19/15,1
lossyrob,there should be functionality for checking if a layer exists,10/19/15,1
lossyrob,and then an error thrown for an update of no layer,10/19/15,1
pomadchin,@echeipesh thoughts are right; mb to have an alternative? `createOrUpdate` like some SQL dsls have,10/19/15,1
lossyrob,"if we do that enough that it really becomes a pain, then we can add that sugar",10/19/15,1
lossyrob,"I_„Žm thinking that in `ETL`, we should have another step in the `IngestPlugin`",10/21/15,1
lossyrob,"so instead of `load` bringing in the tiles and merging hem into the key type and container type, have source tiles that the user could potentially merge in a different way",10/21/15,1
lossyrob,"@echeipesh it seems like the ETL stuff is setup so that an `IntestPlugin` could be reading from a catalog, and an `IngestInputPlugin` would be something that would take a source and do tiling. Should there be implementations of a catalog input plugin for the different backend types, or at least a naming structure that differentiates what_„Žs there with the potential catalog backends? e.g. `S3IngestInput` as opposed to `S3Input`",10/21/15,1
echeipesh,"@lossyrob It_„Žs almost there, that_„Žs been a long term plan. But if you look at the types for the Accumulo ingest plugin you see that a lot of argumenst are straight up not required. For instance there is no reason to ask for layout scheme when you_„Žre going to be reading from a catalog. So there should be more work to create `InputPlugin` and some flow from params to it. But basically both `InputPlugin` and `IngestInputPlugin` have the same output type, which makes it composable.",10/21/15,1
pomadchin,"Hm looks ugly, an update fuction in a write object",10/24/15,1
lossyrob,@pomadchin @echeipesh so I_„Žm looking at the update function,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,and I_„Žm wondering about the `Format` approach,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,because the Format is just doing what readers and writers already do,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,and it_„Žs really just an update function we want,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,I was mentioning a bit ago that my preference would be an `update` function on the Writer,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,that takes an RDD of the appropriate type,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,"that overwrites any tiles that are already in the layer, adds new tiles, and updates the metadata",10/26/15,1
lossyrob,"and then the merging could happen at antoher stage. For example, you_„Žd have the tiles you_„Žd want to have updated. You_„Žd use a reader to fetch the layer as it already is, perform a merge, and then call update on the writer",10/26/15,1
echeipesh,"So to write some code:```scalaval reader = S3LayerReader[SpatialKey, Tile, RasterRDD](""bucket"",""key"")val writer = S3LayerWriter[SpatialKey, Tile, RasterRDD](""bucket"", ""key"", ZCurveIndexMethod)val update: RasterRDD[SpatialKey] = ??? //got it this from somewhereval id: LayerId = ??? // Id of layer we are trying to updateval existing = reader.query(id).where(Intersects(update.keyBounds)).toRDDval update2 = existing merge updatewriter.update(id, update2)```That_„Žs a bit of work right there in a middle that_„Žs just book-keeping, I_„Žm not thrilled with that.",10/26/15,1
lossyrob,what do you mean by book-keeping?,10/26/15,1
echeipesh,"getting the keybounds, using those key bounds to query for layer to update, merging the layer. The last is potentially very variable, but the first two are always the same.",10/26/15,1
lossyrob,then there can be some sugar functions in front of it,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,reader.query(id).where(Intersects(update)) merge update,10/26/15,1
echeipesh,"Intersects on RasterRDD, yeah, thats not bad.",10/26/15,1
lossyrob,and then if we really wanted we could throw sugar in front of that too,10/26/15,1
echeipesh,My feeling `update` probably should be on writer because it shares so much logic.,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,"```scalaval writer = ???writer.mergeUpdate(reader, id) { tilesToUpdate => tilesToUpdate merge update }```",10/26/15,1
lossyrob,yeah I_„Žm thinking the same thing,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,"`writer.mergeUpdate(reader, id)(_ merge update)` seems pretty short",10/26/15,1
echeipesh,"I_„Žd be ok with that actually being a function on writer, not just sugar",10/26/15,1
lossyrob,well it would expand to the same thing you wrote,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,"so it would still be sugar, just defined on writer",10/26/15,1
echeipesh,"One weird part, and this could just be naming, is that writer already has `keyIndexMethod`, which we have to disregard on update (and use the method in attribute store).",10/26/15,1
lossyrob,that is weird,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,why is that not an argument to write?,10/26/15,1
echeipesh,"another potential point is that you could be reading tiles from reader that_„Žs not actually connected to the wrighter, like from S3 and update to hadoop.",10/26/15,1
echeipesh,"it would break the `Writer.write(key, value)`contract, which is quite nice.",10/26/15,1
echeipesh,Plus it would make it easier to remove if/when we decide to standardize on one SFC.,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,"I don_„Žt think we_„Žll ever want to pin down only one SFC, since that could be used to optimize say against focal operations",10/26/15,1
echeipesh,"Well, I think naming that constructor argument _„ñdefaultKeyIndexMethod_„ might make that clearlier.",10/26/15,1
echeipesh,@pomadchin `LayerFormat` almost feels like it wants to be a type class that abstracts over reading/writing/updating for some types to some backend. Where you thinking about particular use case for that from client code?,10/26/15,1
echeipesh,,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,yeah. `defaultKeyIndexMethod` might make sense,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,though it seems like it might deserve a bit of separation between what has the update method and what is actually going to write the layer (producing a Writer of the nice trait implementation),10/26/15,1
lossyrob,it also has some arguments that don_„Žt make sense in the update case,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,"```scalabucket: String,    keyPrefix: String,    clobber: Boolean = true```",10/26/15,1
lossyrob,(in S3_„Žs case),10/26/15,1
lossyrob,wait nevermind,10/26/15,1
echeipesh,"It_„Žs true, all of those would be read from existing attribute store.",10/26/15,1
lossyrob,oh right. what happens if the attribute store points at a different catalog,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,then it_„Žs not really an update,10/26/15,1
echeipesh,You mean that attributeStore that is contained by the writer?,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,the attribute store contained by the reader,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,points to a specific bucket and such,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,"like you were saying, s3 to hadoop is possible",10/26/15,1
lossyrob,but that_„Žs not an update,10/26/15,1
echeipesh,"I_„Žd do the reading from `writer.attributeStore`, but that doesn_„Žt change the source of the tiles. Could be a user-be-ware scenario, can_„Žt raelly think of a way to forbid it.",10/26/15,1
echeipesh,Actually we could read both the reader and writer attributeStores and check that the location matches.,10/26/15,1
echeipesh,Throw out a warning if it is not the same type or location is not the same. ,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,warning and then continue with a plain write?,10/26/15,1
echeipesh,"Not sure, it could be a legitimate case where you are doing cross backend update. It would be weird, but why cut that use case if it can be done predictably?",10/26/15,1
echeipesh,add a _„ñforce: Boolean = false_„ argument on `mergeUpdate` just for this case ?,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,eh. I guess I_„Žm confused.,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,"but the writer has an attribute store, and is going to be pulling out the metadata for that layer, right",10/26/15,1
lossyrob,and updating it with the new metadata,10/26/15,1
echeipesh,correct,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,"so if you called update on a layer that didn_„Žt exist, then it seems like that would be an error",10/26/15,1
echeipesh,"Also, the reader attributeStore needs to be updated somehow, but that_„Žs different issue.",10/26/15,1
echeipesh,"I_„Žm talking about the case where layer exists both in reader and writer but reader is not pointing to the same format as the writer. So the update COULD happen without error, it_„Žs just weird.",10/26/15,1
lossyrob,what do you mean format?,10/26/15,1
echeipesh,"writer on s3 and reader on hadoop or writer on s3(bucket1, prefix) and reader is on s3(bucket2, prefix)",10/26/15,1
lossyrob,"well, the reader is done by that time",10/26/15,1
lossyrob,"you read out tiles, and then do stuff",10/26/15,1
lossyrob,"and then later, you write them to the later to update them",10/26/15,1
lossyrob,so it doesn_„Žt matter where they came from,10/26/15,1
echeipesh,"not if it_„Žs passed to `writer.mergeUpdate(reader, id) { tilesToUpdate => tilesToUpdate merge update }`",10/26/15,1
lossyrob,in the sugared `mergeUpdate` it just does it in a way where it_„Žs working with the same layer and same catalog,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,"oh right, you pass the layer",10/26/15,1
lossyrob,"but even there, it_„Žs not a hard requirement that they are the same",10/26/15,1
echeipesh,not at all,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,i guess it would be quite weird,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,because the locations could be different but for same layerId,10/26/15,1
echeipesh, exactly. I_„Žd say either don_„Žt worry about it or add a `force` if two `attributeStores`don_„Žt contain the same header for the layer id. Preference on the former at the moment. ,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,"does sort of call for a backend thing that can point to say a bucket and a key, provide both a writer and a reader, and just have a plain update on it for the id_„_.something like, maybe a catalog_„_ahh!",10/26/15,1
pomadchin,"hm yep, just an update job with `Format` object looks much prettier as a DSL though also though about update function in writer, and passing add reader looks not very ._.",10/26/15,1
pomadchin,yes `Format` is heavy too,10/26/15,1
echeipesh,"sorry, I don_„Žt know this word _„_ `cat-alog` Something from youtube ?",10/26/15,1
echeipesh,I think it_„Žd be possible to have something that extends both reader and writer? Why did we discount that?,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,"that_„Žs the Format, which is just delegating to a reader and writer you pass in",10/26/15,1
echeipesh,but do it without delegation?,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,then always have a writer when you have a reader?,10/26/15,1
echeipesh,well yeah,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,always have to put in the writer stuff when you need a reader,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,feels right to allow them to be separate,10/26/15,1
echeipesh,"one other thing I mentioned, LayerWriter has everything* it needs to construct a LayerReader",10/26/15,1
lossyrob,always?,10/26/15,1
echeipesh,* - nearly,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,or just under the backends we have now,10/26/15,1
echeipesh,"basically always, I am having hard time thinking of a case it would not be",10/26/15,1
echeipesh,If anything writer always needs to know more about backend than the reader,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,I_„Žd still like to be able to update from tiles that completely originate outside of the layer,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,i.e. do the desugared example,10/26/15,1
echeipesh,"so have `.update` and `.mergeUpdate`, the later would create a reader?",10/26/15,1
lossyrob,"so if the update necessarily creates a reader, i think that would be restricting",10/26/15,1
echeipesh,"anyway, these would need to be fused, and then you can always  make a reader: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/io/s3/S3LayerWriter.scala#L29",10/26/15,1
lossyrob,"I think working towards a `writer.update(layerId, rdd: BoundedRDD[(K, V)])` would make sense as a first step",10/26/15,1
lossyrob,what would need to be fused?,10/26/15,1
echeipesh,"`RDDWriter[K, V] and RDDReader[K, V]` into `RDDFormat[K, V]`",10/26/15,1
lossyrob,why are we trying to fuse them now? didn_„Žt we just pull them apart lol,10/26/15,1
echeipesh,"the layer readers, not but RDD reader, I don_„Žt see why not, *shrug* ",10/26/15,1
lossyrob,"I_„Žd be against fusing, if not for just to try to stop the cycle of fuse and defuse",10/26/15,1
lossyrob,"reading and writing seem to be useful as separate concerns, so let_„Žs keep them that way. and then figure out what cases they need to be combined and only combine them there",10/26/15,1
echeipesh,"sounds like another +1 to `writer.mergeUpdate(reader, id) { tilesToUpdate => tilesToUpdate merge update }` ?",10/26/15,1
lossyrob,"I think that_„Žs sugar, so I_„Žd go with nailing `writer.update` first",10/26/15,1
lossyrob,and making sure that works and makes sense,10/26/15,1
echeipesh,agreed,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,@pomadchin thoughts?,10/26/15,1
pomadchin,would not it be an overhead to init _„ƒreader' inside writer? ,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,"it would, if you were doing multiple updates",10/26/15,1
lossyrob,but we_„Žre stepping away from that now,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,and talking about an API like what Eugene put above,10/26/15,1
lossyrob,I_„Žll restate it,10/26/15,1
pomadchin,"kk, looks not bad lets start with `writer.update(layerId, rdd: BoundedRDD[(K, V)])`",10/26/15,1
lossyrob,"```scalaval reader = S3LayerReader[SpatialKey, Tile, RasterRDD](""bucket"",""key"")val writer = S3LayerWriter[SpatialKey, Tile, RasterRDD](""bucket"", ""key"", ZCurveIndexMethod)val update: RasterRDD[SpatialKey] = ??? //got it this from somewhereval id: LayerId = ??? // Id of layer we are trying to updateval existing = reader.query(id).where(Intersects(update)).toRDDval merged: BoundedRDD[(SpatialKey, Tile)] = existing merge updatewriter.update(id, merged)```",10/26/15,1
lossyrob,cool. I think that scopes it to what the task is pretty well. Then figuring out nicety of API can happen afterwards,10/26/15,1
pomadchin,"kk, will remove this fat Format; though tested that it works with Hadoop and with Accumulo ",10/26/15,1
echeipesh,"nice, probably means the update on writer is going to work just as well.",10/26/15,1
lossyrob,nice. The components of the `update` function should basically be the same,10/26/15,1
pomadchin,yep,10/26/15,1

pomadchin,"hm, seems to me smth is missing here:```scalaval existing = reader.query(id).where(Intersects(update)).toRDDval merged = existing merge updatewriter.update(id, merged)```",10/26/15,1

pomadchin,"so mb rdd merge function should encapsulate metadata merging?or using this explicit `update` user going explicitly write metadata? ",10/26/15,1
pomadchin,ouch don't read it :d my night foughts it's all clear ,10/26/15,1
pomadchin,th * though questions about meta are actual,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,I wasn_„Žt aware that we didn_„Žt have bounds on the BoundRDD yet,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/BoundRDD.scala#L30,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,"but once we do, that_„Žs really all the metadata we need, no?",10/27/15,1
pomadchin,hmm,10/27/15,1
pomadchin,the `MetaData` (`RasterMetaData`) exactly should be updated,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,updated with what new information?,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,"the rastermetadata should be updated in the store for sure. but what new information we need from the update RDD (the set of tiles we want to update the layer with), I don_„Žt think we need that to be a whole RasterRDD[K]",10/27/15,1
lossyrob,"we just need the RDD[(K, V)] and the keybounds",10/27/15,1
lossyrob,which is what BoundRDD should be/will be,10/27/15,1
pomadchin,hm,10/27/15,1
pomadchin,and what about extent?,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,the extent follows the grid bounds,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,i think. let me check,10/27/15,1
pomadchin,"```scalaattributeStore.writeLayerAttributes(id, existingHeader, combinedMetaData, combinedKeyBounds, existingKeyIndex, existingSchema)```",10/27/15,1
lossyrob,yeah,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,so the extent gets carried around with the metadata,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,"and is really derived from the keybounds, no?",10/27/15,1
lossyrob,hmm.. I guess on ingest it_„Žs read from the raw tiles,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,so what happens if we want to update with an arbitrary set of tiles? Should the extent grow to encompass new tiles? or should an extent be passed in?,10/27/15,1
pomadchin,yes and on in the Write object it writes metadata got from the Container,10/27/15,1
pomadchin,think extent should be changed if the update rdd is wider than already ingested,10/27/15,1
pomadchin,or somehow intersects it,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,"right, but changed by the derived extent from the KeyBounds?",10/27/15,1
lossyrob,or are we going to need an explicitly stated extent?,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,"e.g. one from RasterMetaData, or one passed in by the user",10/27/15,1
pomadchin,hm,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,"I can imagine instances where really I_„Žd just want to be able to work with part of a layer as an `RDD[(SpatialKey, Tile)]`, and eventually update the layer with that",10/27/15,1
lossyrob,which would maybe have to derive the KeyBounds from the RDD,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,and then the extent from the KeyBounds,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,"how about that? having an overload that takes a `RDD[(K, V)]` that derives the keyboudns and the extent, an over overload that takes `BoundRDD[(K, V)]` that already has keybounds and derives the extent, and one that takes `RasterRDD[K]` and then the function doesn_„Žt have to compute the keybounds or the extent ",10/27/15,1
pomadchin,hm think that makes sense,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,@echeipesh what needs to be done to get keybounds on BoundRDD? Is there potential for doing that before the whole partitioner feature?,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,be back in a bit,10/27/15,1
pomadchin,(:,10/27/15,1
pomadchin,"if it is a separate pr, it is possible mb to define a generic merge on `Container with RDD[(K, V)]` type, so the result will be merged explicit metaData, not derived from the keyBounds; and after that make same with the `BoundRDD` type, with an overloaded constructor",10/27/15,1
lossyrob,Can we talk through the use case for a second?,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,The new tiles that are coming in,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,"do they have MetaData associated iwth them? if so, how?",10/27/15,1
lossyrob,"Do you do an _„ñingest_„ (without sink) on the RDD of new tiles, and then you want to call update instead of sink?",10/27/15,1
pomadchin,"yes just an ingest, but updating",10/27/15,1
lossyrob,ok. then it makes sense to just go with satisfying that use case for now,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,"and later we can add the ability to update with a `BoundRDD[(K, V)]` and `RDD[(K, V)]` later",10/27/15,1
pomadchin,"(' tiles inside, already ingested', ' tiles outside, not ingested') ~~~> ('update already ingested layers with the new, outside tiles') ; so there comes out that the merge tiles function can be different, not only mosaic, but overlaping, etc (mb makes sense)",10/27/15,1
pomadchin,":D so interesting, want to make with BoundRDD too :d so will start now, think @echeipesh has some thoughts",10/27/15,1
lossyrob,"ok, here_„Žs a thing",10/27/15,1
lossyrob,"if you_„Žre ingesting from raw tiles for the update, then you_„Žre going to want the layout scheme for the layer",10/27/15,1
pomadchin,"eh, yes; would be fail with different schemes",10/27/15,1
lossyrob,writing some faux client code...,10/27/15,1
pomadchin,so anyway this thing should be handled in the update function,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,let_„Žs figure out how to handle it in client code and then see where to wrap things in a function,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,we don_„Žt store a layoutScheme with the layer,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,oh but there_„Žs an overload of RasterMetaData that doesn_„Žt need it,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,"ok, let_„Žs take a look at this and see what it tells us",10/27/15,1
lossyrob,"```scalaval bucket = ???val prefix = ???val layerId = ???val attributeStore = new S3AttributeStore(bucket, prefix)val existingMetaData = attributeStore.cacheRead[RasterMetaData](layerId, AttributeStore.Fields.metaData)val crs = existingMetaData.crsval layout = existingMetaData.layout// Need to get the correct key index method.

lossyrob,one question this brings about is about the KeyIndex,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,what happens if we are updating with tiles that go outside the KeyIndex_„Žs bounds?,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,"I think we_„Žd have to throw an exception. and that_„Žs the KeyBounds that the index was created with, not the KeyBounds of the layer",10/27/15,1

pomadchin,"```scalaval decompose = (bounds: KeyBounds[K]) =>        existingKeyIndex.indexRanges(bounds).map { case (min, max) =>          new AccumuloRange(new Text(long2Bytes(min)), new Text(long2Bytes(max)))        }```we calc it",10/27/15,1
lossyrob,?,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,That_„Žs for index ranges of other key bounds,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,but I mean the key bounds of the entire indexed space,10/27/15,1
pomadchin,oh ye in metadata document,10/27/15,1
pomadchin,"```scalaattributeStore.readLayerAttributes[AccumuloLayerHeader, MetaDataType, KeyBounds[K], KeyIndex[K], Schema](id)```",10/27/15,1
lossyrob,That key bounds is the key bounds of the layer,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,not of the index space,10/27/15,1
pomadchin,yes,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,they can be different,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,"and if they aren_„Žt, then the key index would have the keybounds of the layer, and if you try to update tiles outside of the layer keybounds, then what happens?",10/27/15,1
pomadchin,"seems to me in this case, all layer should be reindexed?",10/27/15,1
lossyrob,yeah. that or an error thrown. not really another way to handle it,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,so now I_„Žm trying to figure out how to get the keybounds of the index space,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,because you could have been smart when ingesting,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,and known that you are going to actually update the layer to a larger area later,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,the the KeyIndex you used had a bigger key bounds than the original layer,10/27/15,1
pomadchin,and to preset the the bounds,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,"so if you did that, we still need to check that the KeyBounds of the index space is not violated",10/27/15,1
lossyrob,"so the KeyBounds of the layer (and the one in the attribute store) would still be the smaller one of the RDD, but the index space would have larger bounds",10/27/15,1
lossyrob,and this line actually doesn_„Žt allow what I_„Žm talking about,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/io/s3/S3LayerWriter.scala#L51,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,so we_„Žd need to figure out a way to be able to do that,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,"I gotta switch spots, talk to you later",10/27/15,1
pomadchin,kk,10/27/15,1
pomadchin,"seems `_.indexRanges(bounds)` solves the problem",10/27/15,1
pomadchin,"if `(min, max)` pair is out of the existing bounds the would be weird thing",10/27/15,1
lossyrob,what bound are you comparing them to?,10/27/15,1
echeipesh,"@pomadchin @lossyrob I think a pretty convincing argument could be made to remove extent from `RasterMetaData`, so that would removes one concern. We will have NoData in the edge tiles, so it_„Žs not clear why extent for the data would be really useful. As far as KeyBounds, they can be collected using `Boundable` type class until they are appear on `BoundedRDD`. Also, I don_„Žt know if you want to consider this but some Indexing schemes aren_„Žt concerned by KeyBounds, for instance Z index will index the same regardless of what bounds are.",10/27/15,1
lossyrob,"Hilbert is though, and I_„Žm still convinced we_„Žll switch to that after we start cluster testing in earnest",10/27/15,1
lossyrob,"also there_„Žs no way to pass in a different keybounds to index than the layer being saved, which is a problem that we have to consider 1) for updating and also 2) for accumulo writing to the same table",10/27/15,1
echeipesh,"Possibly, just pointing that case out for consideration.",10/27/15,1
lossyrob,true. Z index would probably be fine even with the bounds not being considered,10/27/15,1
echeipesh,"Right, so either it_„Žs magically ok, as in Z curve. Or it_„Žs invalid if out of bounds, as in Hilbert.",10/27/15,1
echeipesh,"pomadchin tested that, Z curve is def fine without considering init bounds.",10/27/15,1
lossyrob,"ok, cool-ish",10/27/15,1
lossyrob,half cool ha,10/27/15,1
pomadchin,not sure about ZCurve(!),10/27/15,1
lossyrob,quater-cool,10/27/15,1
pomadchin,:D,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,either way we have to figure out how we want to think about the keybounds of the index space as independant from the keybounds of the layer,10/27/15,1
pomadchin,"): now testing to load rather big maps on a data set (2000 - 2015 years, space time key)",10/27/15,1

pomadchin,+,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,"well, reindexing for say S3 would be moving files around (or deleting and writing). Which would be a pain, but it_„Žs possible",10/27/15,1

pomadchin,sounds safe :D,10/27/15,1
pomadchin,more safe,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,yeah.,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,"It would mean reading the whole layer, merging in the new tiles, and then writing with the new index",10/27/15,1

pomadchin,hm deleting is a nice feature,10/27/15,1
pomadchin,a like deleting tiles o: lots of space after that appears,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,"yeah, except when it_„Žs on S3 and you_„Žre paying for the deletes",10/27/15,1
pomadchin,)`: i got no S3,10/27/15,1

lossyrob,lol,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,umm,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,about which part?,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,sorry I_„Žm between this and a bunch of other stuff,10/27/15,1
pomadchin,yep ,10/27/15,1
pomadchin,about an upate pr,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,well yeah. but what_„Žs the current point where we need a plan?,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,We could do the code that I put above,10/27/15,1
pomadchin,"hm, we found out that we need to remove meta data, that there is a problem with hilbert, and not complete BoundedRDD ",10/27/15,1
lossyrob,so the client code I put above,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,"we could do that, if the keybounds of the index space are not violated",10/27/15,1
lossyrob,which means that we aren_„Žt updating tiles that are outside of the layer,10/27/15,1
pomadchin,kk,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,and so we_„Žd have to either reindex when the bounds are changed,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,which seems like a bunch of work,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,or require that the index bounds be set big enough on the layer,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,"we need a delete layer feature, which can be separate but is pretty important. that way re-indexing is just loading up the layer, merging in whatever, and then saving it a new layer",10/27/15,1
lossyrob,perhaps we need a rename operation along with a delete operation,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,"but as a first step, nailing the case where the bounds are not violated",10/27/15,1
lossyrob,and throwing an exception if they are,10/27/15,1
pomadchin,got it,10/27/15,1
lossyrob,might be the first good nudge along this path,10/27/15,1
pomadchin,"seems zcurve is ok; though  special intersection should be defined for the keybounds (space time case), and not to get intersection cube, but some plane, for a certain time",10/27/15,1
pomadchin,"or it should be as a cube o: anyway it is not a problem, and easy redefining on the client side; so the only ingest problem can be really with hilbert",10/27/15,1
pomadchin,o:,10/27/15,1
pomadchin,even on the client side**,10/28/15,1
lossyrob,"ok. good to know the zcurve works, but that_„Žs sort of incidental to the implementation; just by reading the code it seems like it could easily not work (and the hilbert curve doesn_„Žt have an implementation that makes it work).",10/28/15,1
lossyrob,What do you mean by the keybounds intersection need? I_„Žm not clear on what you meant by thta,10/28/15,1
lossyrob,@echeipesh this might be of interest to your research into spatial joins in Spark: http://spatialhadoop.cs.umn.edu/publications/p1602-eldawy.pdf,10/28/15,1
lossyrob,"has a section, ""3.3 Spatial Join Performance""",10/28/15,1
pomadchin,"@lossyrob ment smth like:```scala// for SpaceTimeKeydef maxSpatialBound(a: SpaceTimeKey, b: SpaceTimeKey): Option[SpaceTimeKey] = {      if (a.time == b.time) Some(SpaceTimeKey(math.max(a.col, b.col), math.max(a.row, b.row), a.time))      else None    }```",10/28/15,1
lossyrob,what is that used for?,10/28/15,1
pomadchin,"just a thought about generic ingest, or i_„Žm missing smth?if there ingested layers for years 2010, 2011, 2013 and we want to update 2011 year, just a KeyBounds intersection will not give us a cube of keys?",10/28/15,1

pomadchin,o:,10/28/15,1
echeipesh,"wonder if we can make it even more better by shipping just the borders, not the whole neighborhood tiles around",10/28/15,1
lossyrob,"yeah, that would take some processing time to cut the borders out of tiles, but then again we save on shipping costs",10/28/15,1
lossyrob,"one thing is, I don_„Žt know if the underlying stuff (which I think uses CompositeTile) allows for differently-sized components",10/28/15,1
echeipesh,"There is a bit of work to test that theory out, and it would need to be tested on a cluster. I wish somebody would do it  :)",10/28/15,1
lossyrob,add it to the list of things to test once we start our cluster benchmarking,10/28/15,1
echeipesh,Going to write up an issue for it and pray to open source gods to send a hero foretold in the chronicles of GitHub.,10/28/15,1
echeipesh,"Hmm, another thought is that we could do better by building a larger neighborhood, 2x2 tiles in the center or 4x4 tiles in the cetner.",10/28/15,1
lossyrob,"that_„Žs sort of based on how big the tiles are ingest at, right?",10/28/15,1
echeipesh,"yes, you_„Žd need to target some ideal neighborhood tile size",10/28/15,1
echeipesh,"But `CellGrid` tells us that information, so doesn_„Žt sound unreasonable",10/28/15,1
lossyrob,"would perhaps be good to have it as a parameter into the focal method, then",10/28/15,1
echeipesh,"Yeah, I_„Žm going to spend an hour or two actually testing that. Did some back of the envelope and it potentially has a huge impact on the groupBy complexity",10/28/15,1
lossyrob,that effect is going to be hard to test without a cluster,10/28/15,1
lossyrob,what are you proposing again? maybe a bit unclear,10/28/15,1
echeipesh,I think it_„Žs going to be visible even locally. If it_„Žs at all measurable I_„Žll spin on up,10/28/15,1
echeipesh,basically do focal calcs on meta-tiles,10/28/15,1
echeipesh,assemble CompositeTile from 2x2 or 3x3 tiles in the center + borders vs always doing 1 tile in the center then then borders.,10/28/15,1
lossyrob,hmm ok,10/28/15,1
lossyrob,what would the paramter be in that case?,10/28/15,1
echeipesh,"basically with 1x1 meta tile each tile contributes up to 9 rows in flatMap. With 2x2 center each tile contributs to 3 rows in flatMap, with 3x3 tiles in the center some tiles contribute to only 2 rows and some to only 1 row.",10/28/15,1
echeipesh,"the size of the center, but we can determine that from tile layout for RasterRDD case.",10/28/15,1
lossyrob,"so intsead of holding 9 tiles in memory at a time (or less with border cuts), we_„Žre holding 4 + border (up to 12) or 9 + border (up to 16)",10/28/15,1
lossyrob,so perhpas there_„Žs a sweet spot where you_„Žre not blowing up memory but decrease combines,10/28/15,1
echeipesh,"We_„Žre always holding all the tiles _„ñin memory_„, it_„Žs just when we_„Žre doing groupBy, it can be over smaller list.",10/28/15,1
lossyrob,we don_„Žt always hold all the tiles in memory,10/28/15,1
echeipesh,"exactly. And statistically you_„Žre _„ñWasting_„ less border pixels for larger center tile, even without cutting it up.",10/28/15,1
lossyrob,https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/rdd/PairRDDFunctions.scala#L503,10/28/15,1
echeipesh,"Oh, sorry, I misunderstood, yes I agree.",10/28/15,1
echeipesh,You meant holding tiles in memory per focal operation round,10/28/15,1
lossyrob,yeah. smaller tile groups (in number per group) lets the work be chunked up more,10/28/15,1
echeipesh,"Yep, but tiles are never that big 16 256x256 tiles of doubles is only 8MB",10/28/15,1
lossyrob,"if it_„Žs parameterized, then once we start cluster benchmarking we can do 1x1 vs 3x3 in the center",10/28/15,1
echeipesh,yep yep,10/28/15,1
lossyrob,"well, you might be working with bigger tiles",10/28/15,1
lossyrob,"1024x1024, multiband, starts getting to some limits methinks",10/28/15,1
echeipesh,"right, but you know the tile size from `TileLayout`, so you can fix the size of the focal area in pixels and float the size of the focal area in tiles",10/28/15,1
lossyrob,well that_„Žs where the parameter is a question. do we say number of tiles or number of pixels?,10/28/15,1
lossyrob,"I_„Žd prefer number of tiles, and externalize the trickery with the TileLayout math for the client to do if they_„Žre smart",10/28/15,1
echeipesh,"Well, there is going to be implemintation on naked RDD[(K, V)] and that HAS to be parameterized by tile count.",10/28/15,1
echeipesh,"method for RasterRDD can try to overload the parameter to both, we can make a good guess and give a door for alternative.",10/28/15,1
echeipesh,"ever seen class family like this:```scalatrait Grid {  val cols: Int  val rows: Int}trait MetaGrid extends Grid {  val subgrid: Grid  val cols: Int  val rows: Int}```",10/28/15,1
lossyrob,no need to declare `cols` and `rows` in MetaGrid,10/28/15,1
echeipesh,"true, but question stands :)",10/28/15,1
lossyrob,"looks like a Node sort of setup, with a parent",10/28/15,1
pomadchin,"oops guys today was fixing my cluster (that zcurve time problem, figuring out where that version got bugs ) ): today will push some changings to the feature update to discuss; though working method update available now",10/28/15,1
pomadchin,In writer; but it's dirty a little ._.,10/28/15,1

lossyrob,"do you understand the core problem? That there is a native set of `.so` files that are installed by GDAL java bindings, into `/usr/local/lib`. Those have to be of the same version as the `gdal.jar` being built with your scala project. `geotrellis-raster` pulls in `gdal.jar` in a specific version, which will most likely conflict with if you try to pull in a `2.0.0` jar.

lossyrob,https://github.com/lossyrob/netcdf-geotrellis-spark-read-test/blob/master/build.sbt#L8,10/29/15,1
lossyrob,just as this line brings in spark as a dependnecy,10/29/15,1
lossyrob,you need to bring in the gdal dependency. also you_„Žll have to exclude it from `geotrellis-spark` like @pomadchin was saying,10/29/15,1

melvinvarkey,i got the whole idea but,10/29/15,1

lossyrob,https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/project/Dependencies.scala#L29 is what that dependency should look like,11/4/15,1
timothymschier,"Sorry, I was a bit unclear. Dependencies shows net.sfs.opencsv; it was only in the proj4 that showed au.com.bytecode.opencsv: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/proj4/src/main/scala/geotrellis/proj4/EPSGCSVReader.scala#L19",11/4/15,1

lossyrob,no it shouldn't,11/4/15,1
timothymschier,ok,11/4/15,1
lossyrob,that_„Žs the import statement. The Dependencies.scala file is what we use to just abstract our dependencies out of our build files,11/4/15,1

lossyrob,I_„Žll check,11/4/15,1

timothymschier,yep,11/4/15,1
timothymschier,btw (not sure if relevant) I also found somewhere online that said opencsv had moved to com.opencsv (but only one; most said net.sf.opencsv),11/4/15,1

timothymschier,yes,11/4/15,1
timothymschier,though I'm really sure I was getting it with 2.10 too; that was part of the reason for moving to 2.11,11/4/15,1
timothymschier,but small chance I'm misremembering that bit... so if it works for you with a cleared cache maybe don't worry about it until I can reconfigure back...,11/4/15,1

lossyrob,and why catch it at all?,11/6/15,1
echeipesh,"@lossyrob: More general version is correct since I added the `.initCause` call to preserve the original exception. The thought was to give context to the underlying exception, what layer we_„Žre loading, in order to give users something to switch on.",11/6/15,1
echeipesh,@pomadchin: That is really strange. That should literally be looking for a single row in a table. I wonder if guys on accumulo IRC might have something to say about that.,11/6/15,1

echeipesh,using the new format or the old format?,11/6/15,1
pomadchin,"Z3, by days, using new, reingest master",11/6/15,1
echeipesh,I wonder if there is something about the iterators that we_„Žre using for filtering that is forcing the whole row (all the column families) to be put into memory and that_„Žs blowing the heap. That would be a good guess if the table has a lot of layers.,11/6/15,1
pomadchin,"+1 for the idea, will try on a big data set with RowMajorIndex",11/6/15,1

pomadchin,another step will be to try same data set on z3 ,11/6/15,1
pomadchin,so will be only one time layer ,11/6/15,1
pomadchin,"I've got a feeling that's defiantly right idea, the err appeared after having ~ 7 time layers",11/6/15,1
lossyrob,"@echeipesh I_„Žm wondering the worthwhileness of catching generic excpetions and wrapping it other excpetions. If it_„Žs something worth doing, we should make a pattern of it so it_„Žs clear when to do it, if it_„Žs not we should just not do the catch&throw",11/6/15,1
lossyrob,"and i_„Žm not sure why it_„Žs worth doing, but I could be convinced if there_„Žs convincing arguments",11/6/15,1
echeipesh,"I get your drift. It_„Žs a little hard to answer without client code to reference. But here is one use case: If I_„Žm wrapping exceptions in a spray service and showing the message, then a exception that says _„ñtried to laod a layer X, failed_„ is much more helpufl than _„ñFailed to find attribute X_metadata on s3_„ or something like that.",11/6/15,1
echeipesh,There is a java argument for doing it: http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-exception-handling/exception-wrapping.html,11/6/15,1
lossyrob,"I think you would just catch the general exception in the spray code and state that then, and then the middle exception isn_„Žt worthwhile, yeah?",11/6/15,1
lossyrob,"with java, you have to declare exceptions that can be thrown. and that would be a reason, is a java reason",11/6/15,1
lossyrob,"I guess, if you want the exception to be caught from the spray code that specifically says it_„Žs in the load portion. and you want to match over exception types in an outer try catch, and depend on matching to the correct _„ƒarea_„Ž that the exception would have been thrown. But that would take a pretty consistent wrapping of exceptions based on code areas in order to be consistently useful I think",11/6/15,1
echeipesh,Is that an argument for wrapping exceptions or against ?,11/6/15,1
lossyrob,"it_„Žs saying, in order for wrapping exceptions to be useful in the case of the client knowing which ones to catch and make some use of so that they can talk about where the exception came from in the middle instead of just reporting the source, then we_„Žd have to be very consistent in how we wrapped exceptions and at what levels we wrapped exceptions, and how those wrappers were communicated to the consumers of the library. Which I think is more work than the payoff merits. But if we don_„Žt do it consistently, then there_„Žs no payoff. So I_„Žm in favor of not wrapping.",11/6/15,1

The example of the gt usage (on spray) is here: https://github.com/geotrellis/gt-admin (ingest sample and server projects) But the api is deprecated and not up to master branch ): This code can give you an idea, that it is possible to get tiles by key (spatial / space time) easily, and make a png / tiff output in a desirable projection (though there are some limitations, not all projections still supported), and it is possible to make queries by extent , spatial bounds, time bounds.Gt works on top of spark, so you need it (btw, dunno better idea how to manage lots of big files :D), you can try to use Docker containers (used them on a fat machine to emulate real-like dev cluster (3 nodes) to work with gt apps, there is spark included): https://github.com/pomadchin/accumulo-spark(only spark project):ingesting :https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/ingest/Ingest.scalapyramid: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/ingest/Pyramid.scalaAlso writer and reader:  https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/io/accumulo/AccumuloLayerWriter.scala https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/io/accumulo/AccumuloLayerReader.scala",11/11/15,1

lossyrob,"you would ingest the data into S3 or Accumulo.

lossyrob,"at that point, they will be accessible as a Layer through the LayerReader (either AccumuloLayerReader or S3LayerReader, in geotrellis.spark.io.{accumulo|spark}",11/11/15,1

(I agree, setup needs to be better). 2) The trick is that there are multiple SpacePartitioners that have different order of prefixes. But that check to align partitions can be done on driver side as RDDs are chained. So they are effectivaly merged on computations (on inner join that is) 3) locality preference: yes. It only matters when joining more than one RDD, that_„Žs a good thing to point out.",11/17/15,1
echeipesh,"I_„Žll re-read and refine it further, I_„Žd love to have some feedback and discussion. Thanks for the comments.",11/17/15,1
lossyrob,can you clarify what you mean by _„ñdifferent order of prefixes_„?,11/17/15,1
echeipesh,"Sure, if two RDDs cover different regions they will be covered by different set of prefixes. For the purprose of RDD partition index we_„Žre just going to sort them and use that index.

lossyrob,ok. maybe there_„Žs a better term then prefix?,11/17/15,1
echeipesh,region ?,11/17/15,1
lossyrob,"so, prefix is meaning, the specific region of the space filling curve that is of a lower resolution than the actual curve",11/17/15,1
echeipesh,"quadtree wiki uses terms quadrant or region. Since this could be 3 d, region seems better.",11/17/15,1
lossyrob,partition region?,11/17/15,1
echeipesh,"yes, thats a better way of saying it.",11/17/15,1
lossyrob,"So there_„Žs two partition regions that match, but they are assigned different partition numbers in the respective SpaceParititioners",11/17/15,1
echeipesh,yep,11/17/15,1
lossyrob,so the two SpacePartitioners need to have the same Region resolution,11/17/15,1
lossyrob,or could one have less resolution,11/17/15,1
echeipesh,For the moment yes. Although interestingly enough `NarrowDependency` allows to return a List of partitions.,11/17/15,1
echeipesh,"So I_„Žm guessing if that list is always lower than some fairly low constant, like 4, it would be ok.",11/17/15,1
echeipesh,"In future we might be able to join two RDDs that are partitioned one zoom level apart, so to speak. So one partition might match 4 partitions in another RDD.",11/17/15,1
lossyrob,right. and a lower-resolution region partition bounds should always fully contain or not contain any region of a higher resolution partitioner,11/17/15,1
echeipesh,correct,11/17/15,1
lossyrob,is it worth trying to bake that in now? Can we come up with use cases for that?,11/17/15,1
echeipesh,I don_„Žt think so,11/17/15,1
lossyrob,I can in the vector case,11/17/15,1
echeipesh,"I think it_„Žs mostly going to control for partition size, but there isn_„Žt an exact target there, _„ñnot too small_„ and _„ñnot too big_„ can be covered by a single value.",11/17/15,1
lossyrob,"for larger features, it might have a lower region resolution, and for more dense point data say, it would have higher",11/17/15,1
echeipesh,Plenty of things to worry about here before dealing with vector ideas.,11/17/15,1
lossyrob,yeah. I just don_„Žt want to have to do deep refactors if we can account for it now,11/17/15,1
echeipesh,"I think that part of it should be pretty hidden behind RDD API, so refactors shouldn_„Žt be very deep.",11/17/15,1
echeipesh,"Anyway, partitioning geometries of non-uniform size is much harder problem I think.",11/17/15,1
lossyrob,what about two RasterRDDs of different density,11/17/15,1
lossyrob,and if we_„Žre tooling to partition size as in number of tiles stored,11/17/15,1
echeipesh,you mean with two different tile sizes ?,11/17/15,1
lossyrob,the region resolution of the less dense one will be less,11/17/15,1
lossyrob,no. same tile size,11/17/15,1
echeipesh,so how could they have different density ?,11/17/15,1
lossyrob,"so, NEX has a specific density, full coverage uniform monthly",11/17/15,1
lossyrob,and I have a much less dense imagery set,11/17/15,1
echeipesh,so annual or something ?,11/17/15,1
lossyrob,or some yearly set say. that maybe doesn_„Žt cover the whole land,11/17/15,1
lossyrob,yeah,11/17/15,1
lossyrob,"so in order to have the aprtition size correct on either RDD, the region resolution is different",11/17/15,1
lossyrob,(I_„Žm not sure how we come up with that region resolution number),11/17/15,1
echeipesh,"That actually auto scales, two RDDs will have different number of partitions.",11/17/15,1
echeipesh,So each region can have at most N elements.,11/17/15,1
lossyrob,"right, but will they have different _„ñleast significant bits""",11/17/15,1
lossyrob,"so in order for the more dense region to have at most N elements, that region needs to have more significant bits. and for the less dense, it needs less significant bits. So the matching gets into this one-to-many dependency thing",11/17/15,1
echeipesh,"Ah, I see what you_„Žre getting that. There will be 12 keys from first RDD and 1 key from right RDD. I think that_„Žs actually really good argument for CoGroup like interface. where you would get Iterator[A] with 12 tiles and Iterator[B] with 1 tile.",11/17/15,1
lossyrob,but the keys are the same,11/17/15,1
lossyrob,"and in the tiles case, will still just have 1 tile from rdd A and 1 tile from rdd B",11/17/15,1
echeipesh,I don_„Žt think I follow. They keys can_„Žt be the same. Otherwise you have 12 records in RDD a with the same key,11/17/15,1
lossyrob,sorry. disregard that statement,11/17/15,1
lossyrob,but the cogroup iterables are not based on the partitions,11/17/15,1
lossyrob,they are based on the values of the keys in each rdd,11/17/15,1
echeipesh,"But I see what you_„Žre actually asking. It_„Žs a good question, I don_„Žt have a fully baked answer for that actually, let me think about it.",11/17/15,1
echeipesh,"Sure, you just need to have a rule that matches keys to partitions to be able to discard partitions fully before you do per-key match.",11/17/15,1
lossyrob,yeah. I_„Žm just wondering how that plays into the narrow dependency thing. Where we_„Žd have a set of narrow dependencies from one RDD and one narrow dependency from the other,11/17/15,1
echeipesh,What you are saying is that its possible to have dataset that are sparse and you would never reach full density provided by partitining your space. That_„Žs true. You essnetially have unused space because of your data layout.,11/17/15,1
echeipesh,I think the question I need to answer is how to join two RDDs where one is indexed annually and another is indexed monthly (as their maximum densities).,11/17/15,1
lossyrob,"well, not _„ñindexed_„ as in the SFC index that is used for storage",11/17/15,1
lossyrob,but the SFC that_„Žs used for the partition regions,11/17/15,1
lossyrob,"so one space is using a SFC with a lower resolution, and the other an SFC with a higher resolution (to index the regions), and then how do we combine those",11/17/15,1
echeipesh,"yep, thats the question",11/17/15,1
lossyrob,"this is assuming that if I put a SpacePartitioner on the lower density RDD, it would come up with the lower resolution SFC for the region partitions, and if I applied a SpacePartitioner to a higher density it would higher density on the region partitioners. And then I do a join between them.",11/17/15,1
lossyrob,yeah,11/17/15,1
echeipesh,I_„Žll have to see what the limist of NarrowDependency are exactly,11/17/15,1

bneff,I've added my own raster to the geotrellis-spray-tutorial.  The NODATA for this raster is -99999.  Is there a way I can specify the NODATA so the statistics don't include these values?,11/19/15,1
echeipesh,@bneff: GeoTrellis uses constant NoData values for performance reasons. For int tiles it_„Žs the contstant NODATA. If you_„Žre reading your layer from GeoTiff the conversion will happen if the GeoTiff tags are set to mention NoData value. If your ingest process is different you can .map over Tile and replace the values manually.,11/19/15,1
bneff,"@echeipesh: ok got it.  I was amazed how how fast everything was, but adding that map process is like 10x slower.  I converted my GeoTiff to ARG using gdal_translate, so I'll look at that for a bit unless you have the options handy.",11/19/15,1
echeipesh,did you GeoTiffs have NoData tag on them? I guess gdal_translate didn_„Žt respect that ?,11/19/15,1
bneff,"@echeipesh thanks for pointing me in the right direction.  The source GeoTiff has the correct NoData tag, but if I specify the -of arg in the command line It sets NoData to nan.

lossyrob,"yeah, that HDFS fix is a tough one. I_„Žm not entirely sure what the approach is to solve that",11/21/15,1
lossyrob,you basically have to overwrite the entire map file that any of the update tiles belong to,11/21/15,1
lossyrob,"tbh, what I_„Žve read about mapfiles is, don_„Žt try to update them. they are not meant for updates. at least that_„Žs waht I remember reading",11/21/15,1
lossyrob,"https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/io/MapFile.html: Map files are created by adding entries in-order.

pomadchin,"@echeipesh suggested to make copy on write, so i think a nice idea would be the following: * read only intersected tiles (already ingested, will call them old)* merge them with new (`val rdd = newRdd merge oldRdd`)* read all tiles except interseted, and make union:  (`rdd union neIntersectedRdd`)* wirte to a _new dir_* rename _old dir_ (or fix metadata dir for layer)* rename _new dir_ to _old dir_",11/21/15,1

lossyrob,there are issues that are marked for 0.10,11/21/15,1
lossyrob,but not really. I should perhaps put one together,11/21/15,1
lossyrob,@pomadchin congrats on getting the PR merged in!,11/23/15,1
pomadchin,@lossyrob yeeeee,11/23/15,1
pomadchin,need to work harder to include more cool features into gt and faster make them ready to merge:0 ,11/23/15,1
lossyrob,@echeipesh ping,11/24/15,1
lossyrob,I responded to your PR comment.,11/24/15,1
lossyrob,"Also looking back over your SpatialJoinRDD issue. There_„Žs the line: ""We also do not have to consider sparse tile layouts, assuming that tiles are, or nearly, continuous for some region.""",11/24/15,1
lossyrob,I thought that was a clear case that we needed to support? Sparse tiles as in a layer of satellite images that are taken at odd time intervals and do not necessarily cover a whole spatial region?,11/24/15,1
echeipesh,"By sparse in spatial sense I mean there isn_„Žt a region here and region there. So if there is some region thats contionous in our space, I wouldn_„Žt call that sparse. Perhaps better terminology is needed ?",11/24/15,1
echeipesh,I guess sparse with regards to KeyBounds.,11/24/15,1
lossyrob,"Perhaps. So, if I have a set of images, some may be clustered around a certain time (say DigitalGlobe was tasked with taking images around an area), and other images are far out from there (we are combining with Landsat), and the area that is covered is pretty large but not necessarily covered by many images, or there are a lot of holes if you consider the region as a bounding box. Wouldn_„Žt that be sparse for KeyBounds?",11/24/15,1
echeipesh,Odd time intervals can make it sparse wrt to KeyBounds. I_„Žm not sure if that invalidates the whole space partitioning approach. The alternative is to do some kind of sampling to do data partitioning.,11/24/15,1
echeipesh,"If there are a lot of holes in the bounding box that would be sparse, yes.",11/24/15,1
lossyrob,"Ok. I don_„Žt know if we should make that assumption then. It could be that, the spatial partitioning works better if the dataset is more uniform (which would make sense), but we should keep that use case on the table",11/24/15,1
lossyrob,"Does it have disastorous effects on that use case, or is it just, the more sparse the less the partitions are even?",11/24/15,1
echeipesh,sparse data would create skinny of empty partitions,11/24/15,1
lossyrob,"And what happens if there are empty partitions under the scheme, do they get excluded or would the RDD have empty partitions?",11/24/15,1
echeipesh,They can_„Žt be excluded because they_„Žre built without examining the data. So nobody knows they will be empty until the operations start running.,11/24/15,1
echeipesh,I don_„Žt know what the practical implications of it are exactly. Spark will of course examine and chug through empty partitions quickly,11/24/15,1
lossyrob,Ok. that sounds similar to a RangePartitoner that doesn_„Žt have data in some ranges,11/24/15,1
lossyrob,I wonder what happens there,11/24/15,1
echeipesh,I think a course of action would be to implement the current plan and benchmark on sparse datasets to get sense of the tradeoff.,11/24/15,1
echeipesh,RangePartitioner actually samples the data with replacement to try to build balanced ranges.,11/24/15,1
lossyrob,"ok. That makes sense, but I_„Žd take out the no-sparse assumption from the list",11/24/15,1
echeipesh,"Alright, it makes sense.",11/24/15,1
lossyrob,"I_„Žm actually doing some edits to the issue, just for clarifying sentences and such. I can either email you with that copy or just edit the comment directly if you don_„Žt mind",11/24/15,1
lossyrob,I_„Žll bring up any actual changes I_„Žd want to make (like taking out that assumption) here,11/24/15,1
echeipesh,"I don_„Žt mind the edits, I think it would be worth while to make an extra post for significant ones like _„ñcan not assume sparse data""",11/24/15,1
lossyrob,"Like, post it in the comments? I just want to send it around (someone is talking about spatial joins in the geowave gitter), and don_„Žt want them to have to read through the comments to get the final picture",11/24/15,1
echeipesh,"I meant for an edit log, but I guess nobody has really read it yet, so no matter.",11/24/15,1
lossyrob,"Yeah, it_„Žs too bad that there_„Žs not a commit history on it",11/24/15,1
echeipesh,"Hmm, Gist has commit history, but then it_„Žs hard to find.",11/24/15,1
lossyrob,we could work it out in a gist at first,11/24/15,1
lossyrob,"want to copy the markdown and paste it into a public gist, then I can make an edit to it? Then we can link the final issue text to the gist in case people want to see it_„Žs development",11/24/15,1

echeipesh,@lossyrob: to clarify your comment from https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/pull/1224#issuecomment-161336133,12/2/15,1
echeipesh,There was a case where exception with `.initCause` was hiding information instead of just adding an explanation ?,12/2/15,1
lossyrob,yes. casey was asking why there was a layer read error,12/2/15,1
lossyrob,he had to search in the logs to get the inner stack trace,12/2/15,1
echeipesh,"Ah, the inner stack trace was not being returned in the service endpoint",12/2/15,1
lossyrob,yeah. It just hides it from the most obvious place you_„Žre looking for an error,12/2/15,1
pomadchin,"hm, it is possible just to wrap exception object",12/2/15,1
lossyrob,what do you mean by wrap?,12/2/15,1
pomadchin,"to incapsulate in our specific exception class```scalacatch { case e: Exception => new LayerUpdateError(id, e) }```",12/2/15,1
pomadchin,"and may be not to catch this generic exception type, but to catch only specific, like in the pr: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/pull/1224/files#diff-d137ca27a2c10efc9851011d922212caR39",12/2/15,1
echeipesh,Not sure that would solve the stack trace hiding. At least with `.initCause` you have special consideration when it is printed,12/2/15,1
lossyrob,what throws an UnsupportedOperationException?,12/2/15,1
pomadchin,"oops seems like a wrong handled thing, but it happens while updating an empty rdd, sec will check it ",12/2/15,1
pomadchin,"found, so caused by `getKeyBounds` on an empty set (reduce fails)```scaladef getKeyBounds(rdd: RDD[(SpaceTimeKey, X)] forSome {type X}): KeyBounds[SpaceTimeKey] = {      rdd        .map{ case (k, tile) => KeyBounds(k, k) }        .reduce { combine }    }```",12/2/15,1
echeipesh,"Ok, I_„Žm looking around code bases trying to see how people use initCause and the rule seems to be that the thing that is being thrown needs to be an Exception. I think what feels wrong here is that it_„Žs not obvious that something like `LayerNotExistsError` is always exception rather than control flow.",12/2/15,1
echeipesh,"This is an exception, essentially layer is in invalid state: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/bad3d2436a15ceba20889564ce5bc87f78ca07e3/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/io/accumulo/AccumuloTileReader.scala#L50",12/2/15,1
echeipesh,"Hmm, I_„Žve ran into similar problems before. It_„Žs always like we need a special instance of empty KeyBounds",12/2/15,1
echeipesh,Something that you can `foldeLeft` into.,12/2/15,1
echeipesh,It would also allow `Boundable.intersect` return `KeyBounds` rather than `Option[KeyBounds]`,12/2/15,1
pomadchin,"yes, to remove this side effect, or just to add an additional check and to throw an exception",12/2/15,1
pomadchin,"wow, nice",12/2/15,1
pomadchin,for that we need also empty instances of keys,12/2/15,1
lossyrob,I think the try catch should wrap the thing that could potentially throw it and then give it that specific context. It_„Žs the general catchall try catch that is weird and information-erasing,12/2/15,1
lossyrob,but catching that unsupported around the call that could throw it and then explicity throwing a well described error is a good idea,12/2/15,1
pomadchin,and lots of try catch blocks doesn't look dirty?,12/2/15,1
lossyrob,looking dirty is better than being dirty,12/2/15,1
lossyrob,"I think it_„Žs more explicit. It does sacrifice asthecis, sure, but I don_„Žt mind that when it makes the code more readable and debuggable",12/2/15,1
pomadchin,"ok nice so: * make blocks more specific* and specify more information in a throwed exception",12/2/15,1
lossyrob,"yeah. whenever your catching and throwing, the new thrown error should be more clear, less confusing, and have more information then the thing you originall caught",12/2/15,1
pomadchin,will have a look now too,12/2/15,1
pomadchin,"also, you saw the #1225 , so decided to start with `copy`(looked like it is more obvious):  https://github.com/pomadchin/geotrellis/blob/feature/layer-management-function-copier/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/io/LayerCopier.scala But it seems to me it is too heavy (p.s. this branch is covered with tests: https://github.com/pomadchin/geotrellis/blob/feature/layer-management-function-copier/spark/src/test/scala/geotrellis/spark/io/LayerCopySpaceTimeTileTests.scala)",12/2/15,1
lossyrob,how do you mean heavy?,12/2/15,1
pomadchin,it has `layerReader` and `layerWriter` in this implementation,12/2/15,1

pomadchin,"ok, done; hm, so what to do with exceptions? mb now just to make them more local, and after provide exceptions with more explanations; but the initCause still obfuscates exceptions",12/2/15,1

pomadchin,let me have a look,12/4/15,1
pomadchin,try `import geotrellis.engine.op.local._`,12/4/15,1
bneff,@pomadchin that did the trick.  Thank you!,12/4/15,1
moradology,"Hey @bneff - this behavior is the result of so-called 'implicit extension'. basically, if you've got a class that you want to monkey patch (in a type-safe fashion), you can do that by defining scala implicits at the call site. Here's what did the work when you imported `geotrellis.engine.op.local` (to give you a sense of what's going on): https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/engine/src/main/scala/geotrellis/engine/op/local/package.scala",12/4/15,1
moradology,kind of a cool pattern in that it allows us to organize the functionality of classes and hide away unused features,12/4/15,1
lossyrob,"Good explination @moradology. Yeah we use implicit classes a lot to add functionality to types without having to modify those types. The one downside is that it_„Žs a bit less discoverable, and if you don_„Žt have the correct imports the methods are nowhere to be found. I_„Žve been trying to think of a good way to mitigate that. Other projects have an `Implicits` object, and the package objects extend traits with all the implicits, and the Implicits object also extends all of those traits, so a `import geotrellis.raster.Implicits._` would import all of the extensions without having to dig around the packages",12/4/15,1
moradology,others do something like `import scalaz._; import Scalaz._`,12/4/15,1
moradology,ugh,12/4/15,1
moradology,Where Scalaz is some big object to hold conveniences for things in scalaz,12/4/15,1

lossyrob,yeah not sure what a good name for it would be,12/4/15,1
pomadchin,"mb it would be interseting, there is even an implicit calculus, so this pattern described formal: https://ropas.snu.ac.kr/~wclee/papers/pldi12a.pdf",12/4/15,1
lossyrob,that paper is intense,12/4/15,1

moradology,"'Our calculus aims at providing a formal model ofimplicits, but there are some noteworthy differences between •___and Scala implicits. In contrast to •___, Scala has subtyping. As discussedin Section 5.2 subtyping would require some adaptations toour calculus.'that is a *BIG* difference.",12/4/15,1
bneff,@moradology thanks for the great explanation.  It really helps me digest all of this information.  You are all very helpful,12/4/15,1
pomadchin,"@moradology ye, but think it shows that it's possible, but they are basing not on DOT, but on the classic system F btw, heard from some scala guyz, from epfl, that probably soon there would be a real article about DOT",12/4/15,1

jamesmcclain,"Hello, I just wanted to start conversation about the polygon intersection task that I am working on.  The basic idea that I want to use for this is to find some set of rectangles that approximate the polygon, then generate a non-overlapping set of keybounds from those rectangles.",12/7/15,1
jamesmcclain,I am suggesting an approximate solution because this page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_covering seems to imply that computing exact solutions is not generally feasible,12/7/15,1
lossyrob,"tbh, this could use the rasterization code",12/7/15,1
lossyrob,which does find an exact grid cell coverage for polygons,12/7/15,1
jamesmcclain,I thought about that,12/7/15,1
jamesmcclain,"I see, okay.",12/7/15,1
jamesmcclain,"I didn't know whether you wanted to find an algorithmically-driven answer, or an engineering one",12/7/15,1
lossyrob,"the only thing is, the code considers the center of cells as the inclusion/exclusion, where we would want an intersection that doesn_„Žt include the cell center to be included",12/7/15,1
lossyrob,what do you mean by algorithmically driver/engineering?,12/7/15,1
jamesmcclain,"Well, my reasoning is something like this: it should be possible to generate an approximate set that is pretty tight in no more than O(n lgn) time, where n is the number of vertices",12/7/15,1
jamesmcclain,Then generate keybounds from the covering set,12/7/15,1
jamesmcclain,That has an algorithmic flavor,12/7/15,1
jamesmcclain,The other approach is just rasterize the polygon and not worry about the theoretical efficiency,12/7/15,1
jamesmcclain,Which is an engineering approach,12/7/15,1
lossyrob,"well, there_„Žs a comple of efficiencies that we_„Žre worried about, the coverage generation is not the only one",12/7/15,1
lossyrob,because what is the cost of generating the estimate vs the exact,12/7/15,1
lossyrob,and then what is the cost of fetching non-intersecting tiles vs not?,12/7/15,1
jamesmcclain,"Right, I understand that issue",12/7/15,1
jamesmcclain,I just wasn't sure where people came down on this issue,12/7/15,1
lossyrob,"if it_„Žs between the theoretical efficiency of the one algorithm in isolation vs the actual efficiency of the algorithm in the context of the library, the latter is the way to go",12/7/15,1
jamesmcclain,"Okay, so I'll go with the engineering view",12/7/15,1
lossyrob,perhaps the estimate coverage would be useful in another setting,12/7/15,1
lossyrob,good to keep it in the back pocket,12/7/15,1
jamesmcclain,"Sorry, didn't mean to leave abruptly ... my computer keeps crashing",12/7/15,1
lossyrob,no worries,12/7/15,1

jamesmcclain,Interesting: https://github.com/WikiWatershed/model-my-watershed/issues/1051,12/7/15,1
jamesmcclain,"I thought that I remembered Breshnham's being used for polygon rasterization, but wiki seems to only talk about it in the context of lines",12/7/15,1
lossyrob,"yeah, it finds the line cells",12/7/15,1
lossyrob,"and then per row, iterates over the ranges",12/7/15,1
jamesmcclain,"Cool ... okay, I will modify that other PR then dig into this",12/7/15,1
lossyrob,"so if I have 4 cells that were determined by Bresnham_„Žs in one row, I know that I start at the first, go to the second, then between second and third is a hole, then third and forth on",12/7/15,1

echeipesh,I don_„Žt think we should do this but it_„Žs an interesting idea on how to get polymorism with generic case using implicits:,12/7/15,1

moradology,@pomadchin I'm personally not a big fan of implementing a class for copy/delete; seems heavy maybe?,12/7/15,1
pomadchin,"delete and copy makes sense, due to using specific backend api (especially actual for deleter, and for s3 copier in order not to load huge amount of data to spark memory, btw may be in case of hadoop it is also significant)",12/7/15,1
pomadchin,"but ye, seems heavy too ): ",12/7/15,1
echeipesh,"+1, to tie comment from the PR: I think this too simple to compose over. This is the case where `HadoopLayerManager` can `override` the `move` method to use the `FileSystem` object.",12/7/15,1
pomadchin,"But, there is a SparkLayerCopier which is generic and can be used with any backend in the current implementation, and can work as copier and as reindexer ",12/7/15,1
pomadchin,"@echeipesh yea, will try your comments, think it is a right way; and have to think about @moradology words too",12/7/15,1
echeipesh,@pomadchin Where was it that you had problem with not having empty KeyBounds ?,12/7/15,1
pomadchin,"@echeipesh LayerUpdater, getKeyBounds application to the empty rdd",12/7/15,1

har777,Sorry for the stupid question but I am slightly confused about what geotrellis is. Will it work as a alternative to hadoop gis ?,12/8/15,1
moradology,@harr777 hey - 'who cares?' is never a dumb question in my opinion. can i ask a bit about your use case?,12/8/15,1
moradology,what kind of data are you working with?,12/8/15,1
echeipesh,"@har777 GeoTrellis is mostly a raster processing library, written in Scala, that can be used with Spark. We_„Žre able to store raster layers in HDFS, Accumulo and S3. There is a cool wrapper around jts vector library that makes pleasant to use in scala. So you can use it to implement a _„ñhadoop gis_„, it certainly lives in the same ecosystem. If you can tell us about your use cases we can give you a better idea of what there is to help you.",12/8/15,1
har777,"@moradology @echeipesh My use case is pretty broad/undefined. We have a ton(some petabytes) of data having lon, lat fields. Was thinking about how to utilize them. I guess visualization is certainly one aspect. We also do a lot of queries like ""find me data fields where the location is within this polygon"" and so on. Open to other usecases :) ",12/9/15,1
echeipesh, @har777 Sounds like you_„Žre dealing with a lot of vector data that you need to store/index and query. You should check out GeoWave (https://ngageoint.github.io/geowave/) and GeoMessa (http://www.geomesa.org/). They both impelment a spatial index on top of Accumulo/HDFS. Accumulo is HBase like distributed key/value store. Basically implementing distributed PostGIS.,12/9/15,1
echeipesh,For the moment we are really flushing out features for distributed raster/imagery processing. There has been planning to integrate with GeoWave to use it as a store for both raster and vector information with GeoTrellis providing the post-query analytics. That will be very interesting :),12/9/15,1
ahmetartu,"Hi. I'd like to try out geotrellis over our hadoop cluster. I'm going to use spark to process geotiff files. As I checked out your source code, there is no support for BIGTIFF support. so does that mean the input geotiff file shouldn't be larger than 4GB?",12/9/15,1
echeipesh,"@ahmetartu: Our scala geotiff reader doesn_„Žt support BIGTIFF. We_„Žve read files through GDAL, the deployment becomes a bit more painful though: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/io/hadoop/formats/GdalInputFormat.scala",12/9/15,1
echeipesh,I_„Žm curious about the idea though. It seems like raster larger than 4GB is bigger than what you_„Žd want even one spark partition to be. Would you be reading those in and breaking them up or working on them as is?,12/9/15,1
ahmetartu,"Thanks for the reply @echeipesh , OK. so looks like the only way to handle bigger geotiff files is to break it up into small ones, possible into tiles. Right? I'm OK with GDAL installation that I did that before. Although it's really painful, the problem with GDAL it is not supporting parallel writes, parallel read is OK as I tested in our MPI cluster system. But I'm not familiar to the spark currently. what is the usual way for parallel GEOTIFF read/write that geotrellis supports?",12/9/15,1
moradology,it might make sense to dump them onto HDFS and slurp them up from the machines you parallelize over,12/9/15,1
moradology,"```scalaimport org.apache.hadoop.fs.Pathval hdfsPath = new Path(""someHadoopDirectory"")val binFiles: RDD[(String, PortableDataStream)] = sc.binaryFiles(hdfsPath)```",12/9/15,1
echeipesh,"Yep, what we have been doing so far is hosting GeoTiffs on either HDFS or S3, bring them in, operate and write out. If you_„Žre willing to go through the pain of using GDAL you can make an InputFormat that reads the BigTiffs and tiles them out in one step. Otherwise it can be a seperate job, maybe even written in pyspark where you have access to Rasterio.",12/9/15,1
echeipesh,Our own HDFS catalog are essentally spatial MapFile that gives you ability to partially read a tile layer based on some bounding box. That may be useful as pre-processed format.,12/9/15,1
ahmetartu,Thanks guys. How about converting large geotiff file to SequenceFile format where key can be the spatial index and the value is the binary content of the tile?,12/9/15,1
echeipesh,That_„Žs exactly how we store our layers on HDFS: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/tree/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/io/hadoop,12/9/15,1
echeipesh,"So the converting large geotiff would be some subclass of GdalInputFormat that would give you RDD of (Extent, Tile). If you go down that road, a contribution would be very appreciated :) A couple of people have asked about something like this.",12/9/15,1
ahmetartu,It is good to know that there is a hope :) I can go for the subclassing of GdalInputFormat that looks way cleaner approach. Our hadoop cluster is pretty large one that would be good to test it out in our facility  ,12/9/15,1
echeipesh,"Hmm, are you big tiffs on HDFS ?",12/9/15,1
ahmetartu,"Mostly storing in tiles but I will test it on bigtiffs that might cover whole US, I haven't decided it though.",12/9/15,1
echeipesh,"It escaped my mind that the main problem with GDAL is that the API is based around reading/writing from filesystem. What `GdalInputFormat` does is copy the the geotiff locally and reads it then. That works fine for smaller tiles but I_„Žm thinking for multi GB tiff that_„Žs going to be suboptimal. If they_„Žre already stored in tiles, then you_„Žre golden, that_„Žs basically what it is designed for.",12/9/15,1
echeipesh,How could your MPI cluster read them in parallel over NFS or something like that ?,12/9/15,1
echeipesh,"It would be really sweet if there was `/vsihdfs/` in GDAL, heh.",12/9/15,1
ahmetartu,MPI programs reading in parallel over GPFS and we also tested it on Lustre file system. I don't think NFS is a good idea for high performance IO,12/9/15,1
echeipesh,Agreed about NFS. I have not worked with either of those. They must provided a mounted file system view for GDAL?,12/9/15,1
ahmetartu,"Oh yeah, not mounted directly but there are file system drivers that the programs access the files like they access to local files",12/9/15,1
echeipesh,"Interesting, could be a viable solution for this problem then. Thank you, going to do some reading.",12/9/15,1

moradology,@echeipesh @lossyrob @pomadchin I'm thinking about the colorbreaks object and the rendering of tiles that have noData values and i'm wondering what your thoughts are about inclusion of that kind of information (what color should NoData be?) in the colorbreaks object itself rather than as another piece of data that must be passed along to whatever function needs it,12/10/15,1
moradology,geotrellis/raster/render/RenderMethods.scala illustrates the case I'm referring to,12/10/15,1
pomadchin,it is a very good question,12/10/15,1
pomadchin,as the nodata value varies depending on the tile type,12/10/15,1
echeipesh,"The writer handles that concerns, the question is mapping of NoData to specific color. Right now it_„Žs always transparent. Which we haven_„Žt really had problems with. But it_„Žs a good point that this is something that should be handled by color map. Right now you need a method that takes a color map and a no data color. So if you had cases where different layers required different colarization you_„Žd need to construct your own data type to track the combination and then branch to the correct rendering call.",12/10/15,1

pomadchin,"mm, `JsonFormat` needs only to read / write, think it is not best idea to incapsulate this logic inside this function",12/10/15,1

lossyrob,catching up.,12/10/15,1
lossyrob,"@moradology the renderers have the ability to assign a color to NoData, right? So the color breaks are for actual values, but during the rendering you can pass in a specific color for NoData. If that is there but not exposed through the method API_„Žs then that_„Žs work that needs to be done",12/10/15,1
lossyrob,"@pomadchin @echeipesh I think the way we_„Žre doing metadata right now is not ideal. Trying to read just the mapTransform for an object was a chore, when I was coding a spray service for the workshop. So I_„Žm wondering if we can change the API. Not sure if that overlaps with what you were talking about above, but wanted to bring it up",12/10/15,1
echeipesh,"Not directly, but it_„Žs a good discussion. What were you thinking exactly ?",12/10/15,1
lossyrob,Something that allows me to get RasterMetaData (or whatever the metadata type will be for that layer) without having to know all the other types to try and get from the attribute store,12/10/15,1
echeipesh,"hmm, I_„Žm going to go check it now but you should totally be able to do: `attributeStore.read[RasterMetaData](layerId, _„ƒmetadata_„Ž)`",12/10/15,1
lossyrob,nope,12/10/15,1
lossyrob,because the RasterMetaData isn_„Žt the root json,12/10/15,1
lossyrob,you would get a serialization error,12/10/15,1
pomadchin,we need a sort of json lens for that,12/10/15,1
pomadchin,"but it is possible to read in a such way:```scaladef readLayerAttribute[T: JsonFormat](id: LayerId, attributeName: String): T =    attributeStore.cacheRead[JsObject](id, Fields.metaData).convertTo[T](fieldLens(attributeName))```",12/10/15,1
lossyrob,"it doesn_„Žt by default try to go through the properties and find the json body property that doesn_„Žt throw a serialization error, like say getting a geometry out of feature GeoJson does",12/10/15,1

lossyrob,yeah,12/10/15,1

pomadchin,,12/10/15,1
pomadchin,@echeipesh solves,12/10/15,1
echeipesh,If that works I still wouldn_„Žt advocate that as great solution tbh,12/10/15,1
lossyrob,"there should at least be an API in front of it then, because that detail of how the backend fits it_„Žs metadata into it_„Žs json should be opaque to the user",12/10/15,1
pomadchin,"I am thinking about these function inclusion (or similar)```scala  def updateLayerAttribute[T: JsonFormat](id: LayerId, attributeName: String, attribute: T): Unit = {    val json   = attributeStore.cacheRead[JsObject](id, Fields.metaData)    val fields = json.fields    import DefaultJsonProtocol._    attributeStore.cacheWrite[JsObject](id, Fields.metaData, json.copy(fields =      fields.get(attributeName) match {        case Some(obj) => (fields - attributeName) + (attributeName -> attribute.toJson)        case _ => throw new DeserializationException(s""Could not read '$attributeName' in $json"")      }    ))  }  def readLayerAttribute[T: JsonFormat](id: LayerId, attributeName: String): T =    attributeStore.cacheRead[JsObject](id, Fields.metaData).convertTo[T](fieldLens(attributeName))```",12/10/15,1
lossyrob,yeah. I_„Žm not crazy about that either,12/10/15,1
lossyrob,@pomadchin that might be in the right direction,12/10/15,1
lossyrob,"and this brings up where, the AttributeStore[..] in a general sense is nice, but as a user I actually want a catalog, where I can call methods like `catalog.metadataFor[RasterMetaData](layerId)` or something",12/10/15,1
echeipesh,That could hide all the implemintation information. Not sure that `AttributeStore` should have dedicated methods for metadata.,12/10/15,1
lossyrob,attribute store shouldn't,12/10/15,1
lossyrob,but catalog should,12/10/15,1
echeipesh,re: pomadchin snippet. There is whole lot of ugly logic in those functions in attempt to provide pseudo-migrations. I would have liked to remove all that by the time we release. Doesn_„Žt feel right to mutate the data when storing/reading it.,12/10/15,1
lossyrob,can we just remove it now? What datasets are those migration-shims serving?,12/10/15,1
echeipesh,"I_„Žm ok with that. Catalog can do the equivalent of `attributeStore.read[JsValue](layerId, _„ƒmetadata_„Ž).fields(_„ñmetadata_„).convertTo[RasterMetaData]` and it_„Žd be great.",12/10/15,1
echeipesh,I think we should be able to.,12/10/15,1
lossyrob,yeah. and I think abstracting the catalog is good. because eventually we might not want to use json objects,12/10/15,1
lossyrob,"PostGIS catalog, for instance",12/10/15,1
lossyrob,be able to actually do spatial queries on large sets of layers,12/10/15,1
echeipesh,"That was the line of thinking with attribute stores, you could have a PostGIS attribute store.",12/10/15,1
lossyrob,"yeah, true.",12/10/15,1
echeipesh,Hmm. Kind of starting to sound like catalog would implement AttributeStore inteface ?,12/10/15,1
echeipesh,So for the purpose of readers/writers it would just be key-value store but on that mechanism it could have use facing query API ?,12/10/15,1
lossyrob,"No, I think it would have an attribute store. This idea that the attribute store is _„ñkey_„, _„ñsub key_„ _„ñvalue_„ is a bit of an implementation detail, that maybe a backend wouldn_„Žt want to follow",12/10/15,1
pomadchin,"@echeipesh yes, just a suggestion, motivated by layer copier / mover functions: ```scalaval (existingLayerHeader, existingMetaData, existingKeyBounds, existingKeyIndex, existingSchema) =   attributeStore.readLayerAttributes[Header, cons.MetaDataType, KeyBounds[K], KeyIndex[K], Schema](from)// change smthattributeStore.writeLayerAttributes[Header, cons.MetaDataType, KeyBounds[K], KeyIndex[K], Schema](  to, headerUpdate(existingLayerHeader), existingMetaData, existingKeyBounds, existingKeyIndex, existingSchema)```",12/10/15,1
echeipesh,I think the next question is going to be if this catalog is going to be the same as layer manager.,12/10/15,1
lossyrob,a layermanager will not be doing the same thing as a catalog,12/10/15,1
lossyrob,"so it might be that a catalog provides a layer manager, or something like that",12/10/15,1
echeipesh,catalog is for discovery and layer manger is for affecting change?,12/10/15,1
lossyrob,"something like that. catalog is the source of truth. LayerManager uses that to do it_„Žs thing, so do readers and writers",12/10/15,1
moradology,I noticed the Statistics object doesn't include a count,12/10/15,1
moradology,"seems like that might be useful, but i suppose you can get that from the tile itself",12/10/15,1
moradology,geotrellis.op.stats,12/10/15,1
lossyrob,Wouldn_„Žt be a bad idea to add it. It would represent the count of non-NODATA values,12/10/15,1
lossyrob,"make it a Long though, if you can imagine running it on a distributed tile set, you could end up with many cells",12/10/15,1
moradology,"yeah, that makes sense",12/10/15,1
moradology,"i just implemented zonalStats and i've got plenty of time left on this task, so i'll see how much is involved to extend the stats object",12/10/15,1
lossyrob,"There_„Žs actually some code that I found that uses RasterExtents to represnet the whole cols and rows for Raster RDD_„Žs, and that shouldn_„Žt be, because they would need to be Long values",12/10/15,1

jamesmcclain,Only changing the way active edges are computed will probably make this faster for sufficiently large polygons,12/15/15,1

lossyrob,Here is the new benchmark project: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis-benchmark ,12/15/15,1
pomadchin,so with `TransformingIterator` usage it is not possible to copy layer to another table,12/15/15,1
echeipesh,@lossyrob: in scalliper is there a difference between using `setUp` and just doing the setup in the `Benchmark` constructor/body?,12/15/15,1
lossyrob,yes,12/15/15,1
lossyrob,"well, perhaps",12/15/15,1
echeipesh,@pomadchin The the only valid case would be to rename a layer in the same table ?,12/15/15,1
lossyrob,you_„Žd be closing over the outer object; the idea is to have a clean object that is easily instantiated by the other JVM that will do the benchmarking,12/15/15,1
lossyrob,"it uses Kryo to serialize the benchmark objects. So not having any values actually filled out, and relying on the setUp function that_„Žs called on the other side of the fence, keeps things cleans\closure free",12/15/15,1
pomadchin,"@echeipesh yes, so with this iterator it is posible to change any part of the key (not sure about rowid); but only in one table, it caused by the thing that scanner works only with one table",12/15/15,1
echeipesh,gotcha,12/15/15,1
pomadchin,"I_„Žm making sample, can push to a separate branch and you_„Žll look through it",12/15/15,1

echeipesh,and each one runs for  `10000` times in each iteration.,12/15/15,1
lossyrob,"note that, for things that run in that sort of time (very fast), you have to take the benchmark results with a cup of salt",12/15/15,1
lossyrob,"in general you should be wary of microbenchmarks results, and look for the consistency in the runs",12/15/15,1
echeipesh,"Yes, to be clear I_„Žm basically reading that as _„ñno difference_„ between structural type and type on a trait. The results are consistent between runs. I_„Žm just checking for bug bears, some crazy reason that it would be a lot slower.",12/15/15,1
lossyrob,@pomadchin confused about the removing of WIP in #1241. Is this because your not working on it? But should it be considered for merging? PR_„Žs that shouldn_„Žt be considered _„ñready-to-merge_„ should have the WIP tag,12/15/15,1

lossyrob,"@echeipesh vanquished RasterRDD, everything worked out fine: https://github.com/echeipesh/geotrellis/pull/5",12/16/15,1
lossyrob,"The one trick is that the contructor of the `RDD[(K, V)] with Metadata[M]` is generic and called `ContextRDD[K, V, M]`. I_„Žm open to different naming, but it seems like, it_„Žs an RDD with a metadata context.",12/16/15,1

lossyrob,for sure,12/16/15,1
lossyrob,@dwins what about this one? https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/issues/1249,12/16/15,1
lossyrob,trying to think of some low hanging fruit/introductory stuff to get you started working on the codebase,12/16/15,1
dwins,ok i'll try and put together a patch for 1249,12/16/15,1
lossyrob,cool. nice to have you helping out!,12/16/15,1
lossyrob,@pomadchin how are things going on your end?,12/16/15,1
pomadchin,@lossyrob there is a dirty version (without fetching by column family): https://github.com/pomadchin/geotrellis/blob/feature/layer-management-function-copier-accumulo/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/io/accumulo/AccumuloLayerCopier.scala,12/16/15,1
pomadchin,but it requires Iterator to be available in Accumulo classpath,12/16/15,1
pomadchin,"so yes, it is possible to change family using api (using `TransformingIterator`); and may be even to reindex (may be not using `TransformingIterator` implementation)",12/16/15,1
lossyrob,whoa. looks complicated ha,12/16/15,1
lossyrob,it requires a custom iterator?,12/16/15,1
pomadchin,yes,12/16/15,1
lossyrob,dang,12/16/15,1
lossyrob,"that would be quite a change, to go from not having any custom accumulo iterators to requiring one",12/16/15,1
pomadchin,"ye, may be to delay it, or not to use in near future o: until we'd have smth more to add to Accumulo classpath",12/16/15,1
lossyrob,"ok. So if we don_„Žt have a custom accumulator, we have to do the spark transformation?",12/16/15,1
pomadchin,yes,12/16/15,1
lossyrob,"gotcha. ok, well I guess it makes sense then to allow for that in the abstraction, but have the Accumulo reindexer use the generic for now. We could add the custom iterator stuff later if we think it_„Žd be worth it",12/16/15,1
echeipesh,"Going over the API with some notes and it all makes sense. Reindexer is the basic problem. Both on S3 and Accumulo it_„Žs hard to imagine how to reindex in place without stomping on yourself. The simple solution is to load to spark, delete, save from spark. But that_„Žs incredibly fragile.",12/16/15,1
echeipesh,https://gist.github.com/echeipesh/812948930d6f5ec7b442,12/16/15,1
lossyrob,That API setup looks good to me,12/16/15,1
echeipesh,"Sure, it_„Žs not too bad, but reindexer question is outstanding :)",12/16/15,1
lossyrob,"ok, so the worry there is that we would have a weird partial reindex",12/16/15,1
lossyrob,which is the stomping on ourselves?,12/16/15,1
echeipesh,"Right, if we_„Žre writing records before the old files are gone, we can_„Žt tell them appart afterwards. If we delete the source files before we write we_„Žre vulenrable to data loss",12/16/15,1
lossyrob,ok. makes sense,12/16/15,1
lossyrob,let_„Žs just go with the safe way. I guess that means generic implementations for all,12/16/15,1
lossyrob,"but also we should keep the trait like you have it, nice and clean, so in the future if we are smarter we can do a smarter thing",12/16/15,1
echeipesh,The safest way would be to Load/Move/Save,12/16/15,1
lossyrob,@pomadchin what do you think?,12/16/15,1
pomadchin,"yes, looks good",12/16/15,1
lossyrob,"ok. The only thing is, do we allow reindex on copy",12/16/15,1
lossyrob,because otherwise we would have to Load/Move/Save (with a delete in there) and then copy,12/16/15,1
echeipesh,"So I would like to suggest a solution from your play book, _„ñmake it a users problem_„. Allow only re-index on copy. Then tracking the workflow is not our problem.",12/16/15,1
pomadchin,"just checking hwo it would be with such methods like ```def copy(from: LayerId, to: LayerId, key: String) def copy(from: LayerId, to: LayerId, bucket: String, key: String)```",12/16/15,1
pomadchin,seems all ok;,12/16/15,1
lossyrob,"the bucket and key (for the S3 implementation) should be in the constructor parameters, no?",12/16/15,1
lossyrob,"so it can implement the `def copy(from: LayerId, to; LayerId)`",12/16/15,1
lossyrob,@echeipesh perhaps. or should we just have Copy have an overload that takes a KeyIndexMethod?,12/16/15,1
lossyrob,wait yeah. The implementations you have in that Gist don_„Žt make sense,12/16/15,1
echeipesh,"My thought on that was is that it can always implement `def copy(from: LayerId, to; LayerId)`. Putting target bucket and key in the constructor doesn_„Žt make much sense from standpoint that it charactirizes the copier. So an extra method is ok.",12/16/15,1
lossyrob,I_„Žm going to fork it,12/16/15,1
echeipesh,"kk, great B)",12/16/15,1
pomadchin,"btw, having `KeyIndexMethod` in function will cause making instance of writer ",12/16/15,1
pomadchin,):,12/16/15,1
lossyrob,"`def copy(from: LayerId, to: LayerId, key: String)`, why the overload sans bucket?",12/16/15,1
echeipesh,"API sugar, leave it out ?",12/16/15,1
lossyrob,"yeah, is there a case wher eyou don_„Žt supply the bucket ever? ",12/16/15,1
echeipesh,"Sure, if you_„Žre just re-organizting the layers in your bucket.",12/16/15,1
lossyrob,@pomadchin understood about the writer.,12/16/15,1
echeipesh,Without that you need to use the attribute store to read the bucket for that layer first.,12/16/15,1
pomadchin,"and with copy: ```scaladef copy(from: LayerId, to: LayerId) // > there would be writerdef copy(from: LayerId, to: LayerId, table: String) // > there would be the other writer```",12/16/15,1
lossyrob,"well, that writer could be supplied in the implementation_„Žs constructor",12/16/15,1
pomadchin,the first?,12/16/15,1
pomadchin,ye,12/16/15,1
lossyrob,for the generic ones,12/16/15,1
echeipesh,That_„Žs actually a pretty good point. Why not make Writer.write have an KeyIndex/KeyIndexMethod overload ?,12/16/15,1
pomadchin,but in general it may have different table (this generic writer in constructor),12/16/15,1
lossyrob,Writer doesn_„Žt have that in the def because then it wouldn_„Žt follow the simple Writer trait interface,12/16/15,1
lossyrob,so instead it_„Žs something that_„Žs supplied in the constructor,12/16/15,1
echeipesh,"That_„Žs true, it would have to be `LayerWriter` that has that, that in turn sublasses `Writer`.",12/16/15,1
lossyrob,"but that means if you want to have one thing that can write to many different index structure, you need to create a writer for each one",12/16/15,1
lossyrob,"@pomadchin working with the API gist. Sorry want to make clear_„_the AccumuloLayerCopier will have to use a Spark copy (Reader/Writer) if there_„Žs no custom iterator? Or can that use the accumulo api, and it_„Žs just the reindexer that would need the generic implimentation ",12/16/15,1
pomadchin,"yes you right, we have to use spark even for accumulo copier, if there is no custom iterator",12/16/15,1

lossyrob,"But in order to start running operations on raster data, you_„Žd have to do some _„ñingesting_„. This takes rasters from their raw format and brings it into an indexed format GeoTrellis can work with",12/18/15,1
lossyrob,what sort of data will you be working with?,12/18/15,1
lossyrob,"I will have a tutorial for how to run GeoTrellis on EMR, hopefully by Monday, which should answer your questions :)",12/18/15,1
pomadchin,"guyz, think #1241 is ready for review",12/18/15,1
owcm,"Hi Rob, thanks for your time.  I am starting with Digital Elevation Model data that is a product of 1 Meter Lidar. Raw format are  Erdas Imagine Images (.img) but I have been using GDAL to create Geotiffs.",12/18/15,1
lossyrob,"Great. Here is a landsat tutorial that I completed the local section of, next week I will be adding the EMR tutorial https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis-landsat-tutorial",12/18/15,1
owcm,So is Geotiff the best Raster format that or ARG?,12/20/15,1
lossyrob,"We've moved away from ARG files in 0.10, so GeoTiffs are best to start with. When data is ingested onto a format that you can read using our spark codebase, they are no longer GeoTiffs, but are avro encoded byte arrays.",12/20/15,1
owcm,Is there any WMS capability in Geotrellis or do I use Geoserver in conjunction  with Geoserver.,12/20/15,1
owcm,Should read .. use something like Geoserver in conjuction with Geotrellis to provide WMS services.,12/20/15,1
lossyrob,WMS capabilities is a often requested feature. I don_„Žt think it will make the GeoTrellis 0.10 release_„_but also I view it as a concern outside of the core GeoTrellis library.,12/20/15,1
lossyrob,My current thoughts on it are to just create a WMS implementation in Spray that is implemented by GeoTrellis functionality. That could happen alongside/after/outside of the GeoTrellis release cycle.,12/20/15,1
lossyrob,"GeoServer integration is another choice, however when I looked at that a while ago I found some of the restrictions and requirements that the GeoServer API would put on GeoTrellis in order to work as a layer would hurt GeoTrellis performance and be a lot of work. I_„Žm willing to revisit it though.",12/20/15,1
lossyrob,"@dwins has a lot of GeoServer experience, perhaps he could comment.",12/20/15,1
lossyrob,"But like I said, that is an often requested feature. I would need to find bandwidth to put it together, but if we go with the scala/spray implementation, it_„Žs a pretty clear task. If there_„Žs anyone that wants to help develop it or throw some resources behind it, get in touch!",12/20/15,1
lossyrob,@echeipesh any insight on what this error could be caused by? I_„Žve been seeing things like this: https://travis-ci.org/geotrellis/geotrellis/jobs/97450134#L5740,12/20/15,1
pomadchin,"@lossyrob @echeipesh looks weird (`Expected exception geotrellis.spark.io.package$LayerNotFoundError to be thrown, but org.apache.accumulo.core.client.TableExistsException`)",12/20/15,1
lossyrob,yeah. like there_„Žs an in memory accumulo that isn_„Žt being cleaned out appropriately or something,12/20/15,1
pomadchin,+,12/20/15,1
dwins,"regarding a WMS implementation, I would also lean toward a Spray-based implementation over GeoServer.  Another option might be to only do XYZ tiling and put GeoWebCache in front to translate to other tile services. GWC can even scale and stitch cached tiles to emulate a non-tiled WMS",12/21/15,1
lossyrob,"That_„Žs interesting about GeoWebCache, I didn_„Žt know it could take a z/x/y tile service and expose it as a WMS endpoint",12/21/15,1
lossyrob,"would we need to do any additional work for that? or just tell clients, if you want to expose the tiles through WMS, throw GeoWebCache in front of it?",12/21/15,1
lossyrob,client applications using GeoTrellis,12/21/15,1
dwins,"lossyrob, actually i double-checked and it doesn't actually have a backend implementation for zxy tile services, there is a pluggable interface but it is only implemented for WMS",12/21/15,1
dwins,so a little improvement in GWC is needed before this could work.,12/21/15,1
dwins,I tried to add a vector subproject to geotrellis-benchmark but got a stack trace when trying to execute a benchmark of no-op. https://gist.github.com/dwins/07d6a5c95595bf2be206,12/21/15,1
dwins,i see the raster module already has jts in scope so I suppose I can do what i was trying to do in there for now,12/21/15,1
dwins,i put my code up here. having a hard time seeing what is different from the raster benchmark. https://github.com/dwins/geotrellis-benchmark/tree/cgalgorithm-benchmark,12/21/15,1
lossyrob,@dwins there's something weird going on in scaliper that I have to fix. But you have to return an object from the test. So returning a string or something might do it,12/21/15,1
dwins,yep that did the trick,12/21/15,1
lossyrob,These travis failures are killing me. I_„Žm going to take out that non-determinant mask spec until @jamesmcclain _„Žs rasterization fixes.,12/21/15,1
lossyrob,"Done. Please update PR_„Žs to master, so that travis will hopefully not fail things when it shouldn_„Žt (although there seems to be other problems with travis and some spark tests)",12/21/15,1
dwins,"More drastic difference than I expected```  Name                                    us  linear runtime  CGAlgorithm.isInRing(coordinat       58.80  ==========  Polygon.contains(Point)             148.83  =========================```",12/21/15,1
dwins,interestingly if I change the benchmark to always test a point outside the ring then Polygon.contains uses hardly any time at all,12/21/15,1
lossyrob,probably because of a bounding box check,12/21/15,1
lossyrob,that is quite a difference,12/21/15,1
dwins,"yep, when i made it outside the ring but inside the bbox the performance difference went away",12/21/15,1
lossyrob,"@pomadchin merged your PR. It looked great, the API seemed on, we have LayerManagers for each backend type, they make sense. If there_„Žs refinements as we move forward we can just make them against master. That was a big one, so congrats :)",12/21/15,1
lossyrob,"@dwins considering the outperformance, I wonder if that the CGAlgorithm version should be the defalut on Polygon, and why it_„Žs not that way in JTS",12/21/15,1

lossyrob,sometimes I try to haha. Ever since Norway I_„Žve had trouble adjusting back_„_late nights coding don_„Žt help,12/22/15,1
lossyrob,@dwins did you benchmark the creation of the `PreparedGeometry` when doing the benchmark comparison to `isPointInRing`? (Issue https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/pull/1255),12/22/15,1
dwins,No. i pushed the benchmark code to my branch,12/22/15,1
lossyrob,"I have always been curious about when or when not to use `.prepare`, and it seemed like the up front cost of the call would have to be high in order to prevent it from always being used",12/22/15,1

dwins,seems pretty expensive,12/22/15,1
lossyrob,"preparing geometries is one of those things that I_„Žm sure would help speed up some code a lot, but I never think to do it. And we don_„Žt want to do it by default because if your not going to be intersecting (or whatever the speedup profile is for prepared geometries is, that_„Žs still a big ? for me), then it_„Žs not worth it to prepare",12/22/15,1
lossyrob,"like, when we do polygonal statistics on a raster, we_„Žre potentially doing a lot of interections on the incoming polygon. we should probably be using prepared there",12/22/15,1
lossyrob,because wow that is a lot faster when you just prepare once,12/22/15,1
dwins,it's better than the 3x i mentioned in the PR - there's a special optimization for point-in-polygon in 1.14 and i had not upgraded JTS earlier,12/22/15,1
rfecher,"I just caught this discussion - yeah we've  done a decent amount of benchmarking with prepared geoms...point in polygon grows linearly with # vertices of the poly without prepared geom, but is constant with prepared geoms",12/23/15,1
rfecher,https://github.com/chrisbennight/intersection-test#points,12/23/15,1
rfecher,"well, by ""we"" it was really mostly @chrisbennight and @rwgdrummer digging into that",12/23/15,1
lossyrob,this is really cool stuff @rfecher!,12/23/15,1
lossyrob,"So it seems like the conclusion to draw is, there_„Žs are some cases where prepared geometries are worth it, and some cases where it_„Žs actually less optimal then normal geometries. Intersections of polygons are faster for small polygons, but once the vertex count exceeds some threshold it is less optimal on prepared geometries. Point-in-polygon operations are always going to be faster with a prepared polygon of any sort of complexity (save the simplist cases)",12/23/15,1
lossyrob,not sure how to enact that in the system,12/23/15,1
zeitalexgithub,I am new to Spark and Geotrellis. What we need is to do mapalgebra on Esri Grids. For example to do grid1-f,12/23/15,1
zeitalexgithub,"Sorry, to subtract 2 grids",12/23/15,1
zeitalexgithub,Grid1-grid2. As I understand to reduce shuffle in the best case these 2 grids should be on the same node? Is it possibble with spark and geotrallis?,12/23/15,1
lossyrob,"yes, best case, if you have a set of tiles of 2 large raster layers, in Accumulo, and you want to do a local operation, say subtract, then the tile that overlap will be on read in on the same machine",12/23/15,1
lossyrob,"another option is that the RDD_„Žs are spatially (N-dimensionally) partitioned before the operaiton, which would offer the same guarentee",12/23/15,1
lossyrob,"(soft guarantee, there might be some issues with overflow)",12/23/15,1

zeitalexgithub,Thanks a lot for your answer.,12/23/15,1
zeitalexgithub,Is it possible to install geotrellis in free ec2?,12/24/15,1
echeipesh,"What do you mean by free ec2, t2.micro instances ?",12/24/15,1
echeipesh,"If so, you might be able to start geotrellis in spark local mode but t2.micro only has 1G memory, so there won_„Žt be much to do anything useful.",12/24/15,1
zeitalexgithub,I would like to test geotrellis. Is the best way to do it is installing it as described here https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis-ec2-cluster ?,12/24/15,1
lossyrob,"@zeitalexgithub that is one way to ge a geotrellis cluster running on AWS, with Accumulo installed and ready for a heavy load. You could also use EMR to run batch jobs, or even run Spark and GeoTrellis locally.

pomadchin,"@lossyrob may be it is posible to try this pattern (in a separate branch), and to see how it goes, currying _may_ help I remember that in some projects divided 'not functions' and _„ƒfunctions', to pass functions as curried arguments, and that looked ok in that cases (but it had an impact on the whole api)",12/27/15,1

jamesmcclain,"@lossyrob Okay, many thanks",1/4/16,1
owcm,"@lossyrob  as you surmised from my questions on the landsat-tutorial  I am wanting to run everything in EMR and read and write my Singleband GeoTIff data to S3.  I prepped my data: projected and  retiled my data following the landsat-turorial pattern,   pushing the end results to S3.  One of things I would like to do on demand is perform large spatial elevation and map algebra operations on the data  I ingested in S3.   The  big picture is building a pipeline where data is ingested and then when complete the elevation/map algebra operations are run and results stored in S3 as well.   I am thinking the best way to read in the data to process and get some spark parallelism is using the  S3RDDReader. Questions I have: Is this a mature API and best approach for getting S3 records in to RDD format, any examples of usage, seems to be based on the AvroRecord spec.  If I want to limit the number of records to read in at a time  do I use the binning feature. Thanks again",1/4/16,1
lossyrob,"S3LayerReader API is pretty much set. We might put some sugar on top and add overloads, but it_„Žs pretty much there. If you ingest data into s3, you can read it out of the catalog (the place where the attribute folder is, that holds the attributes for the layers) using the S3LayerReader. You can do a queried read out of the Reader using the query API. you can call the read with the number of partitions in order to determine how many records to read at a time",1/4/16,1
lossyrob,"but once you have data ingested, things get a lot easier",1/4/16,1
lossyrob,I_„Žm not sure I have some example code to point to just yet,1/4/16,1
lossyrob,but let me see if I can try to freestyle some,1/4/16,1
lossyrob,"```scalaval layerReader = S3LayerReader(bucket, prefix)val rasterRDD =   layerReader.query(LayerId(_„ñingested-data_„, whateverZoom))    .where(Intersects(someExtentOrPolygon))    .toRDD// Now I can do map algebra to it, assuming necessary imports (though we are refactoring to that these will be available via import geotrellis.spark._rasterRDD.localAdd(4).focalMean(Square(1)).histogram //etc```",1/4/16,1
lossyrob,"```scalaval result: RasterRDD[K] = ???// Then to write, just use the S3LayerWriterval writer = S3LayerWriter(bucket, prefix)writer.write(result, LayerId(_„ñsome-other-name_„, whateverZoomLeve))```",1/4/16,1
lossyrob,"this is actually an example. It_„Žs a little behind in the snapshot releases, but still the general gist of things: https://github.com/WikiWatershed/mmw-geoprocessing/blob/develop/summary/src/main/scala/SummaryJob.scala#L92",1/4/16,1
pomadchin,https://gist.github.com/pomadchin/f66f3e8330451de43ff8,1/5/16,1
pomadchin,"@lossyrob @echeipesh so some questions about KeyIndex method: I_„Žve already thought about its rpresentation in a form to have possibility to understand all keys space bounds. But now what problem we have to shoot?or just to move from `JavaSerializationJsonFormat` to `Avro`, and not to loose ZCurve? and the main problem is the `DateTime => Int` function representation?",1/5/16,1
lossyrob,Basically. We don't want Java serialization to be used to store anything long term because it's brittle. So moving to Avro or even Json is the goal,1/5/16,1
lossyrob,"We can't capture the generic Function2 of the date time -> int, so it will take some reworking of how we, and how we allow users, to define z curve key index methods",1/5/16,1
lossyrob,Brb,1/5/16,1
pomadchin,kk,1/5/16,1
pomadchin,"so one way is to provide indexing by parsing a pattern string, so it can help us to define year, month, day, hour, etc indexing",1/5/16,1
lossyrob,I_„Žm a bit worried about performanc cost there,1/5/16,1
lossyrob,to translate to string and then do some regex or datetime parsing,1/5/16,1
lossyrob,tho that may be over-worrying,1/5/16,1
lossyrob,could be settled with a benchmark,1/5/16,1
pomadchin,"`DateTimeFormat.forPattern(pattern)` hm, ok can try to implement it and some alternative version; understood the problem ",1/5/16,1
lossyrob,ok cool.,1/5/16,1
lossyrob,"and I_„Žve been saying Avro, but JSON would be just as well",1/5/16,1
lossyrob,and would fit what we_„Žre doing with the rest of the attribute store better,1/5/16,1
pomadchin,cool,1/5/16,1
jamesmcclain,@lossyrob Howdy,1/5/16,1
lossyrob,heyo,1/5/16,1
lossyrob,so this key index keybounds task,1/5/16,1
lossyrob,let me find the code that is the crux,1/5/16,1
jamesmcclain,"Sounds interesting, okay",1/5/16,1
lossyrob,https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/io/s3/S3LayerWriter.scala#L55,1/5/16,1
lossyrob,that line and the next,1/5/16,1
lossyrob,oh I only recently learned you an multi line link on github :),1/5/16,1
lossyrob,https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/io/s3/S3LayerWriter.scala#L55-L56,1/5/16,1
lossyrob,you can see that we are creating a key index based on the key bounds of the incoming rdd,1/5/16,1
lossyrob,let me talk through a use case where that is bad,1/5/16,1
jamesmcclain,"Okay, I've got the code up",1/5/16,1
lossyrob,"We have some imagery, and we ingest it, write it out to Accumulo or S3 or whatever. Those images date from jan 1 2015 - jan 5 2015",1/5/16,1
jamesmcclain,Okay,1/5/16,1
lossyrob,"and say, it covers some of New Jersey",1/5/16,1
lossyrob,"we write the layer, fine",1/5/16,1
jamesmcclain,Sure,1/5/16,1
lossyrob,"we then want to update the layer with some imagery, this is some older imagery we didn_„Žt catch, so it_„Žs actually from Dec 2014 (I still haven_„Žt switched years in my head apparently), and actually covering PA",1/5/16,1
lossyrob,those tiles are outside of the index that was created for that layer,1/5/16,1
jamesmcclain,Okay,1/5/16,1
lossyrob,the key index is stored as metadata for the layer,1/5/16,1
lossyrob,"so when we get that key index, and try to index the incoming tiles, boom",1/5/16,1
lossyrob,"or negative values, or something bad",1/5/16,1
jamesmcclain,"I see, okay",1/5/16,1
lossyrob,"so, we want to let the user avoid that",1/5/16,1
lossyrob,by knowing in advance the general time range and coverage that layer will have,1/5/16,1
lossyrob,even if the incoming first RDD doesn_„Žt cover it completely,1/5/16,1
jamesmcclain,Okay,1/5/16,1
lossyrob,"so I can say, index this space with Z curve starting from 2010 and covering all the US in this layout",1/5/16,1
jamesmcclain,"Yes, that makes sense",1/5/16,1
lossyrob,"now, the keys would have to match the layout that your creating the index with",1/5/16,1
lossyrob,so there_„Žs some things to think through,1/5/16,1
lossyrob,but allowing the user to set up that key index bounds on the write would allow them to avoid the problem of updating outside those bounds,1/5/16,1
jamesmcclain,"Okay, makes sense",1/5/16,1
jamesmcclain,Do we have a canonical setup for developing S3-related code like this,1/5/16,1
lossyrob,there_„Žs some interplay between the LayoutDefinition of a layer and this that I can_„Žt quite think through immediately,1/5/16,1
jamesmcclain,"Thinking about a project that I can fork, credentials, et cetera",1/5/16,1
lossyrob,hm,1/5/16,1
lossyrob,I don_„Žt htink so. But it would be nice of you to create one for people to use moving forward :),1/5/16,1
jamesmcclain,:-) Okay,1/5/16,1
lossyrob,https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis-sbt-template,1/5/16,1
lossyrob,would be a start,1/5/16,1
jamesmcclain,Alright,1/5/16,1
jamesmcclain,A couple of questions: where should I write my test data? Are the standard credentials that I already have from mmw and modellab sufficient to allow me to do so?,1/5/16,1
lossyrob,perhaps. any s3 bucket will do,1/5/16,1
jamesmcclain,"Okay, sounds good",1/5/16,1
jamesmcclain,"Okay, I may have some questions later, but I think that that is enough information to get me started",1/5/16,1
lossyrob,cool cool,1/5/16,1
jamesmcclain,This task will give me a chance to look through some of the S3 stuff,1/5/16,1
lossyrob,yeah. and feel free to point out inconsistencies/API design flaws/add overloads while you go through it,1/5/16,1
owcm,"@lossyrob Hello  Back on the help you gave me with the landsat-tutorial.  I went and took my source Geotiffs re-projected them and used gdal to break them down into 512x512 tiles.   Then instead of having the tiled directory locally  to create the z/x/ index from I put all of my tiles up on S3  in a simple s3://bucket/tiledirectory  structure.   I thought I would be able to read in the tiles a group at a time, create a tiler RDD  and create the z/x/y indexing, writing the result  into another S3 directory.    Reading your code latest example to me'''val layerReader = S3LayerReader(bucket, prefix)val rasterRDD =   layerReader.query(LayerId(_„ñingested-data_„, whateverZoom))    .where(Intersects(someExtentOrPolygon))    .toRDD'''It appears I need to be creating an index  scheme for the raw tiles I am uploading to S3 initially. Does this sound correct?  Each of my tiles has an extent of course and I believe they are at zoom level 12. Your sample code shows me how to get my tiles into a RDD using a LayerReader but the point I am missing is how to create the catalog  initially in S3.   Sorry to bother you again, is there another good example to look at.",1/5/16,1
lossyrob,No worries. Going from _„ñraw_„ to _„ñingested_„ is the process of reading in the raw tiles via something like https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/spark-etl/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/etl/s3/TemporalGeoTiffS3Input.scala#L14,1/5/16,1
echeipesh,"@owcm: `S3LayerReader` reads layers that are written using `S3LayerWriter`, which writes `RasterRDD[SpatialKey]` for instance. RasterRDD is an RDD that has already been tiled out to some specific tiling scheme. To get there from a bunch of GeoTiff tiles which only have extent you need to go through Ingest/Tiling process. There is an example of that here: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/test/scala/geotrellis/spark/ingest/IngestSpec.scala#L32-L36.  This is so common that we made an ETL subproject to handle this ingest/tile process: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/tree/master/spark-etl",1/5/16,1
lossyrob,potentially reprojecting. Deriving metadata from. Tiling to a certain layout,1/5/16,1
lossyrob,and then saving off to a geotrellis catalog,1/5/16,1
lossyrob,"The TileGeoTiff.scala part of scala-landsat-tutorial is basically doing an ingest. It sinks the tiles using a SlippMapWriter, which is a format of writing the tiles to the z/x/y coordinate scheme. However those tiles are not available as an RDD. You_„Žd have to use a LayerWriter, like S3LayerWriter, to write them out to a separate S3 bucket, at which time they will be avialable and _„ñin a catalog_„ (the catalog is created if you write the layer to a bucket that doesn_„Žt have previous layers written to it).",1/5/16,1
lossyrob,@dwins here_„Žs an example of dipping into JTS world via jtsGeom (and a good call on using identifier for more accurate reprojects) https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/raster/src/main/scala/geotrellis/raster/reproject/ReprojectRasterExtent.scala#L32,1/6/16,1
dwins,cool,1/6/16,1
lossyrob,"If we wrapped densifier, I wouldn_„Žt have to do that. But, if there was some other corner of JTS that we didn_„Žt wrap, I would want to do a similar thing. If there_„Žs some way to do that without breaking immutability, that would be great",1/6/16,1
dwins,https://github.com/dwins/geotrellis/blob/spike-raw-jts-operations/vector-test/src/test/scala/spec/geotrellis/vector/JTSPassthroughSpec.scala has the cases I've been thinking about,1/6/16,1
lossyrob,"another thing is performance. I_„Žll drop down into JTS objects when I want to be fast, and not make copies of everything in the name of immutability. So whatever the solution is, it would need to account for that",1/6/16,1
dwins,definitely,1/6/16,1
dwins,"so that file is doing it with .jtsGeom, and the same file in the previous commit is using the new thing i'm thinking about.",1/6/16,1
lossyrob,whoa,1/6/16,1
dwins,"basically the  idea is to introduce a VectorOp trait and wrap JTS functionality in it, with different wrappers for in-place mutations vs. computations",1/6/16,1
lossyrob,I_„Žm not immediately groking what the VectorOp stuff is doing,1/6/16,1
lossyrob,hmm interesting. I_„Žll have to dive through the code,1/6/16,1
dwins,"The basic idea is that it has 'owned' and 'shared' methods that both perform whatever computation. owned is called when we can assume no one else has a handle to the geometry, shared otherwise",1/6/16,1
dwins,"so if the operation is considered a 'mutator' (which is a thing developers have to figure out manually) then the shared call performs a copy, but in all other cases we just use the reference directly",1/6/16,1

lossyrob,"There_„Žs some code design/architecture choices/notes in this PR that I_„Žd like to start following consistently through the project (or improve and follow a modified or different consistent pattern), so worth reading if you_„Žre hacking on GeoTrellis or want to know how it works: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/pull/1268",1/7/16,1
owcm,"@lossyrob On the landsat-tutorial you perform  2 steps outside of Geotrellis with gdal. 1. Reproject the image using gdalwarp to Webmercator,  2. Tile out the R and NIR bands with gdal_retile.py.  Is there technical reason it was done this way.  I know you can reproject Geotiffs to Webmercator in Geotrellis and could you not tile a raster using standard ops using Geotrellis and feed them directly to the tiler.   Just wondered the technical reasons.",1/7/16,1
lossyrob,"Sure, I can speak to that",1/7/16,1
lossyrob,First is the retiling,1/7/16,1
lossyrob,"the thing about GDAL vs GeoTrellis is, GDAL does some operations on disk while reading internal tiles from GeoTiffs (or however the one of over 100 raster formats can do windowed reads)",1/7/16,1
lossyrob,"in Geotrellis and spark, we read the dataset in memory",1/7/16,1
lossyrob,and some operations require that we hold both the source and target array of the data in memory at the same time,1/7/16,1
lossyrob,"so, the one approach would be to tile out the read in GeoTiff right in memory and ingest from there, and skip retile.py",1/7/16,1
lossyrob,but we_„Žve found it conveniant to take large tiles and chunk them out into smaller tile sizes in a GDAL based preprocessing step,1/7/16,1
lossyrob,we actually do this vi PySpark and rasterio for large tile in S3,1/7/16,1
lossyrob,"as for reproduction, we can do that in GeoTrellis",1/7/16,1
lossyrob,but I was doing it in GDAL for a reason that the GeoTrellis retroject was causing some artifacts to appear,1/7/16,1
lossyrob,"I wasn_„Žt sure why, until I solved it, and now we can skip the gdal reproject of the large raster, once this PR is merged in",1/7/16,1
lossyrob,https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/pull/1268,1/7/16,1
lossyrob,"This will allow us to do reproject of keyed tile sets in spark without losing the accuracy you would have by having all of the pixels available to resample during repreojection of a non-tiled raster, by buffering tiles in preperation of the reprojection operation by some buffer that the adjancent, abutting tiles contribute to",1/7/16,1
lossyrob,I_„Žm going to be changing that landsat demo to use the geotrellis reproject,1/7/16,1
lossyrob,"as for the retile, you could also break that up into an RDD inside of GeoTrellis, and I wonder if there would be a memory issue there, I was just avoiding dealing with too much memory by doing the retile.py. But it would be nice to cut out some of those manual GDAL steps",1/7/16,1
owcm,So if I read in a SingleBandgeotiff and use crop it to break into to  512 x 512 tiles programmatically I would not be accomplishing the same task as the gdal_retile.py. ,1/7/16,1
lossyrob,you totally would,1/7/16,1

jamesmcclain,https://gist.github.com/jamesmcclain/0ea77e77231931da0ddf,1/8/16,1
jamesmcclain,The main area of interest is lines 78-93 and the code called from there,1/8/16,1
jamesmcclain,I should say 79-93,1/8/16,1
lossyrob,yeah that_„Žs a bunch of object sorting,1/8/16,1
jamesmcclain,"The code with the mapping and zipping doesn't seem to be the issue, either",1/8/16,1
jamesmcclain,"I tried doing that with pure arrays, and it was actually slightly slower",1/8/16,1
lossyrob,weird,1/8/16,1
lossyrob,is partial includeIntersecting?,1/8/16,1
jamesmcclain,it is equivalent to `includePartial`,1/8/16,1
jamesmcclain,so that it is true if and only if partial cells are to be reported,1/8/16,1
jamesmcclain,Otherwise only complete cells are (when it is false),1/8/16,1
lossyrob,ok so we_„Žre naming it includePartial instead of includeIntersecting,1/8/16,1
lossyrob,makes sense,1/8/16,1
jamesmcclain,If there is no objection,1/8/16,1
moradology,it appears as though all of the overhead witnessed when combine is used (in the dynamic nodata case as opposed to the macro case) comes from the fact that it's referencing a nodatavalue stored on the tile... direct comparison (e.g. x != 100) is equivalent (or damn near) to the macro case.,1/8/16,1
lossyrob,@jamesmcclain nothing jumps out at me for improvements,1/8/16,1
jamesmcclain,Okay ... like I say the performance isn't that bad;  it could be that the only avenue for improvement is a better algorithm,1/8/16,1
jamesmcclain,But I don't know the graphics literature that well,1/8/16,1
jamesmcclain,I'll ask around this weekend,1/8/16,1
lossyrob,perhaps we should do some benchmarking against other test data,1/8/16,1

jamesmcclain,"Oh, okay -- I had only been using the mapshed polygon",1/8/16,1
jamesmcclain,I'll see what else is there,1/8/16,1
jamesmcclain,On a different topic: thinking about the keybounds issue: it is my understanding that the way to approach this is to find a scenario in which in the  a call to the `update` method on some object derived from `LayerUpdater` fails and go from there,1/8/16,1

jamesmcclain,Updated rasterizer benchmarks: https://gist.github.com/jamesmcclain/7788cc33ec4143462d70,1/11/16,1
Sinmarc,"Hi there, I was just working on that tutorial: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis-landsat-tutorial/blob/master/src/main/scala/tutorial/MaskRedAndNearInfrared.scalaIs there any way to define the signedness of the ArrayMultiBandTile? The types, which are given within the _„ñconvert()_„ only provide the opportunity to define the bit depth. As far as I know, the current version is not able to handle unsigned rasters _„_ Is that correct? It would be very nice if somebody could help me on this topic? ",1/11/16,1
pomadchin,"@lossyrob yo, https://github.com/pomadchin/geotrellis/blob/feature/keyindex-json/spark/src/test/scala/geotrellis/spark/io/accumulo/AccumuloSpaceTimeSpec.scala that_„Žs an api usage with the new KeyIndex serialization",1/11/16,1
pomadchin,":D no differ, hope there would be no additional type params in future also",1/11/16,1
lossyrob,@Sinmarc we have made a change to handle unsigned types,1/11/16,1
lossyrob,so that is in master,1/11/16,1
lossyrob,TBH I might have written that convert call before that was fully implemented. or it might be fore another reason...,1/11/16,1
lossyrob,"But we are currently working out our whole story for unsigned bytes_„_the problem with UByte and UShort is that it_„Žs unclear what a default nodata should be. Our other types have default nodatas, which is a huge boon to performance (by checking against constant values instead of against dynamic user-set nodata values). @moradology is currently adding the capability for UShort and UByte to handle custom NoData values, and our Type story should be complete then. ",1/11/16,1
lossyrob,@jamesmcclain not priority but FYI to fix when you get a chance https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/issues/1281,1/11/16,1
jamesmcclain,"Okay, will-do",1/11/16,1
lossyrob,Take note: scala has some issues with inferring type parameters on implicit classes that extend classes with type classes: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/pull/1282,1/11/16,1
lossyrob,Need to always explicitly state the type parameters in the extended class,1/11/16,1
lossyrob,(this was only happening when packaging in 2.11),1/11/16,1
lossyrob,Interested on other_„Žs thoughts on this vector API issue https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/pull/1275#issuecomment-170629876,1/11/16,1
dwins,"I was also investigating an approach using typeclasses `{def apply[From <: jts.Geometry, To <: gt.vec.Geometry](x: From)(implicit wrapper: Wrapper[From, To]): To }` but it was a little cumbersome and ended up not really addressing the downcast question",1/11/16,1
dwins,"might make sense to have a method for downcasting on Geometry, like GeometryResult's `as[G <: Geometry : ClassTag]: Option[G]`",1/11/16,1
moradology,"as a convenience, that makes a lot of sense to me",1/11/16,1
moradology,it would also make the use of for comprehensions for potentially chained operations a breeze,1/11/16,1
echeipesh,I like the idea of `.as[G]` method on `Geometry`. It is more useful than throwing in a constructor and useful in general when type for geotrellis geometry gets upcast. One would have an option of using that or doing a full match.,1/11/16,1
lossyrob,I think that makes sense too,1/11/16,1
dwins,is that consensus then?,1/11/16,1
pomadchin,:+1: ,1/11/16,1
lossyrob,yessir,1/11/16,1
lossyrob,"@moradology I merged in upstream and made the changes you suggested, is that a +1 on travis build?",1/11/16,1
moradology,"yep, lgtm",1/11/16,1
lossyrob,cool cool,1/11/16,1
lossyrob,looks like travis is throwing a bunch of scala.reflect.internal.MissingRequirementError: object scala.runtime in compiler mirror not found. errors.,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,@echeipesh what are these for? https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/tree/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/mosaic I_„Žm commenting them out and they don_„Žt seem to be used,1/12/16,1
pomadchin,@lossyrob would be used by @jamesmcclain ,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,?,1/12/16,1
pomadchin,"hm out or not :0 but it's a cool stuff to merge layers, not exact tiles, I used it in a client code",1/12/16,1
lossyrob,can you give me the use case?,1/12/16,1
pomadchin,sure,1/12/16,1
pomadchin,"so it would be helpful for @jamesmcclain to update layer out of key bounds (pre set keyounds);smth like to get the existsing rdd and to merge it with the new one.(the loaded rdd had `oldKeyBounds`, the new has intersecting key bounds case)",1/12/16,1
lossyrob,"ok, got it",1/12/16,1
lossyrob,thanks,1/12/16,1
pomadchin,,1/12/16,1

jamesmcclain,Topics that I would like to discuss: 1) This pull request https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/pull/1284 is the CI failure genuine? 2) Keybounds approach in https://github.com/jamesmcclain/geotrellis/tree/feature/jwm/keybounds,1/12/16,1

jamesmcclain,@pomadchin Can we chat a little bit about our respective tasks?,1/12/16,1
pomadchin,"ye sure, just afk for 30mins and will be back",1/12/16,1
jamesmcclain,"Okay, sounds great",1/12/16,1
pomadchin,ty!,1/12/16,1
echeipesh,@lossyrob re: merge layers. That was written both to support layer update functionality and for user code to perform RDD updates in the manner that pomadchin mentioned.,1/12/16,1
pomadchin,@echeipesh :+1: ,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,Ok. it just wasn_„Žt used anywhere so had me confused,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,Request for feedback of  cell type naming scheme: https://gist.github.com/lossyrob/e19365f1e092b77a22b1,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,"(the actual types have more data contained in them, so this is psuedo, but the naming is what_„Žs in question)",1/12/16,1
echeipesh,Long but explicit. Maybe _„ñType_„ suffix can be omitted.,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,"how do you mean, Type stuff?",1/12/16,1
echeipesh,"```scalasealed abstract class CellTypesealed abstract class RawCellsealed abstract class ConstantNoDataCellsealed abstract class DynamicNoDataCell[@specialized(Byte, Short, Int) T] { def noDataValue: T }case object BitCell extends RawCellcase object ByteCell extends RawCellcase object ByteConstantNoDataCell extends ConstantNoDataCellcase class ByteDynamicNoDataCell(nd: Byte) extends DynamicNoDataCell[Byte](nd)```",1/12/16,1
moradology,I like both of these options - i think it makes a lot of sense to keep them long though,1/12/16,1
moradology,especially since end users will largely have no part in this,1/12/16,1
echeipesh,It feels natural but breaks away from traditional type name. I wouldn_„Žt expect this type to  come up too often in user code though.,1/12/16,1
dwins,is it a Cell type or a Band type?,1/12/16,1
echeipesh,It_„Žs the type of all the cells in the tile. So it could be seen as a band type.,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,BandType is in GeoTiffs,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,but yeah they are all representing the type of cells the Tile contains,1/12/16,1
moradology,"then again, this isn't a cell - it is a celltype specification",1/12/16,1
lossyrob,"Yeah I think keeping the 4 characters for Type isn_„Žt much worse in terms of verbosity, it_„Žs already pretty bad",1/12/16,1
lossyrob,and yeah not sure how much the user will encounter it_„_and the explicitlness for users who do encounter it probably is a big plus,1/12/16,1
dwins,i would expect Constant and Variable or Static and Dynamic. Constant/Dynamic seems odd,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,"@Sinmarc this actually deals with some of what your question was about, if you_„Žd be interested in contributing thoughts",1/12/16,1
lossyrob,"@dwins hmm, yeah I guess it does break the usual opposite names for them",1/12/16,1
lossyrob,But Constant/Dynamic doesn_„Žt seem too at odds with me. Does it make sense to others to go with Constant/Variable or Static/Dynamic more?,1/12/16,1
echeipesh,"Constant is very descriptive, its actually a constant check in code, so that should stay.",1/12/16,1
moradology,"this is orthogonal to those distinctions, but since users and readers of the library are programmers it does make some sense",1/12/16,1
moradology,"variable is fine, too",1/12/16,1
moradology,"by my lights, that is",1/12/16,1
lossyrob,"Well, it doesn_„Žt really vary",1/12/16,1
lossyrob,it_„Žs just user set,1/12/16,1
moradology,"yeah, there's something that's just kind of gross feeling about 'variable'",1/12/16,1
echeipesh,"It_„Žs not really dynamic either. Internal/External, Standard/External ?",1/12/16,1
lossyrob,hmm Internal/External is interesting,1/12/16,1
moradology,naming is not fun.,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,"```scalaval tile = ArrayTile.empty(UShortInternalNoDataCellType, 256, 256)```",1/12/16,1
lossyrob,would you know what that meant right away?,1/12/16,1
echeipesh,I think that raises the correct question right away: What is the internal nodata value ?,1/12/16,1
dwins,internal to what? not sure i would think 'internal to the library' right away,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,"```scalaval tile = ArrayTile.empty(UShortInternalNoDataCellType, 256, 256)val tile = ArrayTile.empty(UShortExternalNoDataCellType(32), 256, 256)```",1/12/16,1
lossyrob,"yeah, that makes sense",1/12/16,1
lossyrob,is there something that says _„ñinternal to the library_„ better?,1/12/16,1
echeipesh,"```scalaval tile = ArrayTile.empty(UShortCellType with GeoTrellisNoData, 256, 256)val tile = ArrayTile.empty(UShortCellType with UserDefinedNoData, 256, 256)```",1/12/16,1
dwins,but if you're asking that question then the answer doesn't necessarily have to be a class name. UShortCellType.withNoData(32) might return a UShortExternalNoDataCellType but i don't have to know that,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,@echeipesh I was thinking about withs. Problem with the UserDefined nodata is it needs to take a parameter,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,"@dwins true, we could have some methods on the object that might be more clear. Would be nice to nail it in the type system so that there_„Žs not a multaplicity of ways to say it",1/12/16,1
lossyrob,well maybe with would work,1/12/16,1
moradology,ConfigurableNoData/GeoTrellisNoData,1/12/16,1
echeipesh,Doesn_„Žt have to be in the constructor .. let me see if it works out,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,I_„Žm not hot on the _„ñGeoTrellis_„ tag,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,but _„ñUserDefined_„ is nice,1/12/16,1
echeipesh,Standard instead of GeoTrellis ?,1/12/16,1
dwins,Fixed instead of GeoTrellis?,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,hmm Standard or Fixed is better than GeoTrellis,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,we should see if the `with` would work out in the type system before heading too far down that naming path,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,are you checking that eugene?,1/12/16,1
echeipesh,"yes, playing with that",1/12/16,1
moradology,how are you thinking about adding the nd value?,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,just have it as a val on the triat,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,but it would have to be typed then,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,`UShortCellType with UserDefinedNoData[Short]`,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,Which is cumbersome,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,and you_„Žd want to wrap that as a exlicitly named type,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,which brings us back to the original problem,1/12/16,1
echeipesh,"No pretty way to work around the lack of constructor, something has to have it. So trying to play off the _„ñwith_„ syntax doesn_„Žt help anything.",1/12/16,1
lossyrob,cool,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,so back to the Static/Dynamic Standard/UserDefined Constant/Dynamic etc debate,1/12/16,1
echeipesh,"```scalaimport com.scalakata._sealed abstract class CellTypetrait StandardNoDataCellType extends CellTypeclass DynamicNoDataCellType[@specialized(Byte, Short, Int) T](val noDataValue: T) extends CellTypetrait ShortCellType extends CellTypecase object ShortCellType extends ShortCellType with StandardNoDataCellType {  def withNoData(nd: Short): ShortCellType with DynamicNoDataCellType[Short] =   	new DynamicNoDataCellType[Short](nd) with ShortCellType}@instrument class Playground {val ct1 = ShortCellType//ShortCellTypeval ct2 = ShortCellType.withNoData(33)//ShortCellType$$anon$1@2789e449}```",1/12/16,1
echeipesh,eh ?,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,there_„Žs reasons to not have the anonymous class (there_„Žs more to CellTypes then is in the sample code),1/12/16,1
lossyrob,but that object method could exist whatever we end up calling it,1/12/16,1
moradology,"yeah, that sugar is nice, but i'm partial to just spelling out the types explicitly rather than generating them like this",1/12/16,1
moradology,and with would be better if it were possible to apply a constructor on the trait,1/12/16,1
moradology,Constant/UserDefined,1/12/16,1
moradology,what about *that*,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,/offtopic where is `MosaicBuilder` used?,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,Does `Constant` really convey what we are talking about (to people who don_„Žt know the internals of the library?),1/12/16,1
echeipesh,Not really tbh,1/12/16,1
echeipesh,Is there a reason for CellType not to be parametric on T btw ?,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,nothing would really use that type info,1/12/16,1
moradology,ConstantNoData vs UserDefinedNoData,1/12/16,1
moradology,it seems to me that the distinction between the two makes sense of this,1/12/16,1
moradology,"though in isolation, either is vague",1/12/16,1
dwins,"while i am moving `withGeometryMethods` would it make sense to move `geotrellis.vector.op.ZonalSummaryHandler` as well? should be in its own `geotrellis.vector.zonal` package, right?",1/12/16,1
echeipesh,"```scalasealed abstract class CellType[T](val noDataValue: Option[T])trait StandardNoDatatrait UserDefinedNoDatacase object ShortCellType extends CellType[Short](None) with UserDefinedNoDatacase object ShortStandardNoDataCellType extends CellType[Short](Some(Short.MinValue)) with StandardNoDatacase class ShortUserDefinedNoDataCellType(nd: Short) extends CellType[Short](Some(nd)) with UserDefinedNoData```noDataValue would only be inspected by the tiles that require it, otherwise it_„Žs there to be documenting.

echeipesh,Having an Option would probably require to copy the noDataValue to some constant field to avoid unboxing on every access when checking dynamic tiles.,1/12/16,1
moradology,doesn't @specialized handle that ?,1/12/16,1
echeipesh,But Option isn't,1/12/16,1
moradology,ah.,1/12/16,1
moradology,right,1/12/16,1
moradology,seems like there'd be a lot of extra machinery to pull that off - might be better to just do that where necessary,1/12/16,1
moradology,and where @specialized is possible,1/12/16,1
moradology,though the point about documentation is well taken,1/12/16,1
echeipesh,"A danger would be that a user would use the `Tile.cellType.noDataValue` in a `Tile.map` instead of the macro and just blow the performance right to heck. Where as if `noDataValue` is defined on the bottom most type or specalized in a trait, it wouldn_„Žt be that bad.",1/12/16,1
lossyrob,@dwins yeah that makes sense,1/12/16,1
dwins,cool,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,`Tile.cellType` wouldn_„Žt have a noDataValue,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,it_„Žs only used in the internal machinery of `get` and `set` (and `getDouble` and `setDouble`),1/12/16,1
lossyrob,@moradology ugh that Jpg test starts up that weird boot Java thing. I really don_„Žt get why some code does that,1/12/16,1
moradology,"Yeah, i know, it was a pain in the ass with ~test",1/12/16,1
lossyrob,whenever I use GeoTools the same thing pops up. @dwins do you know what that_„Žs about?,1/12/16,1
dwins,I believe whenever (certain parts of) Swing is engaged it kicks in. I think JAI can trigger it,1/12/16,1
dwins,i wonder if forcing swing to headless mode would prevent it.. there's a system property for that but i forgot what it is,1/12/16,1
dwins,"yeah, you could try invoking sbt  with `-J-Djava.awt.headless=true`",1/12/16,1
pomadchin,"/offtop/ @lossyrob what do you think about having a `keyIndexMethod` in a `Writer` constructor? should it be removed or what do you think? (as I understood correct, the idea is to add `write` function overloads)",1/12/16,1
lossyrob,yeah keyIndexMethods should be taken out of constructor,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,and moved as part of the parameter overloading of write,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,the base overload should take a KeyIndex,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,and overload that takes a KeyIndexMethod should create it off the keybounds of the incoming RDD,1/12/16,1

lossyrob,nice,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,@dwins cool I_„Žm going to set that property on tests and see if it solves it,1/12/16,1
lossyrob,threading through partitioner or numPartitioner to methods that use spark methods that take them is hard,1/12/16,1

lossyrob,not if that_„Žs all the information you have,1/13/16,1
lossyrob,Tile does not have extent information,1/13/16,1
lossyrob,Raster does,1/13/16,1

lossyrob,and the Key,1/13/16,1
owcm,Well I have the spatial key,1/13/16,1
lossyrob,do you have the metadata?,1/13/16,1
lossyrob,there_„Žs a thing on the metadata called a `mapTransform`,1/13/16,1
lossyrob,that will take a spatial key and give you an extent,1/13/16,1
owcm,"Trying to one off HadoopSlippyTileWriter and in setupWrite was trying to get the extent for the the tile. rdd: RDD[(SpatialKey, T) is passed in.  I can see how to get the keys and the till of course but the rdd does not have the metadata attribute,",1/13/16,1

moradology,"perhaps an optional envelope is better, semantically",1/13/16,1
dwins,"in JTS an empty geometry has the special empty envelope: [0,0:-1,-1] which is an identity for the 'expandToInclude' operation, never intersects other envelopes, etc.",1/13/16,1
dwins,Option would be good too,1/13/16,1
moradology,"i've got to say, your knowledge of JTS is very useful",1/13/16,1
moradology,"i wasn't aware that there was an empty envelope, but if it plays nicely with other features in JTS, that's a strong argument in favor",1/13/16,1
moradology,(i'm definitely the greenest in this space and a fortiori JTS),1/13/16,1
dwins,"I think in scala-land I would probably make Extent a sealed trait with EmptyExtent and NonEmptyExtent implementing. but EmptyExtent would give 0,0:-1,-1 as the coordinates in serialization",1/13/16,1

dwins,ok.,1/13/16,1
moradology,"the root vector readme - not the root GT readme, right?",1/13/16,1
dwins,the readme for vector is in `vector/src/main/scala` - should it be in `vector/` instead?,1/13/16,1
moradology,"good question - i believe i put it there just because it is a set of notes pretty close to the code, and some of the subprojects also have readmes",1/13/16,1
moradology,"i'm not sure what the One True Way is, here",1/13/16,1
dwins,oh yeah i noticed that. but it's not really where i expected to find the README,1/13/16,1
dwins,probably more important to be self-consistent within the project than to find out what other folks are doing in this case.,1/13/16,1
lossyrob,I think we need to restructure where we_„Žre putting the readme's,1/13/16,1
lossyrob,I think having a `docs/` folder would be best,1/13/16,1
lossyrob,keeps it separate and clear. Sort of like how `rasterio` has theirs. Except ours would follow the package layout.,1/13/16,1

owcm,I am reading in some spatially adjacent rasters and want to stitch them together to create one raster and perform a local op.  Is there a best way to do this? Do I do it at the RasterSource level or at the tile level. Maybe there is a good example. Thanks in advance.,1/20/16,1
echeipesh,"@owcm: Sounds like your question is about single tiles rather than RDDs of tiles, if so you could use Tile/Raster merge methods: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/d01d9709cd018f910cc80cb256cad6a865874c92/raster/src/main/scala/geotrellis/raster/merge/RasterMergeMethods.scala https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/d01d9709cd018f910cc80cb256cad6a865874c92/raster/src/main/scala/geotrellis/raster/merge/TileMergeMethods.scalaIt would look something like this:```scalaimport geotrellis.raster._val r1 = Raster(IntArrayTile.fill(1, 2,2): Tile, Extent(0,0,2,2))val r2 = Raster(IntArrayTile.fill(2,2,2): Tile, Extent(1,1,3,3))val target = Raster(EmptyTile(TypeInt, 3, 3): Tile,Extent(0,0,3,3))val mergeTile = target.merge(r1).merge(r2)mergeTile.asciiDraw``````scalascala> mergeTile.asciiDrawres27: String =""    ND     2     2     1     1     2     1     1    ND_„ñ```Now that I typed it out I notice a couple of rough corners on that API that we_„Žll have to address:1. The method will only be available for `Raster[Tile]`, thus the cast in `r1` and `r2` definition.2. Defining the target tile can easily cause a resample if you_„Žre not careful to match resolution. ex:```scalascala> val target = Raster(EmptyTile(TypeInt, 6, 6): Tile,Extent(0,0,3,3))target: geotrellis.raster.Raster[geotrellis.raster.Tile] = Raster(IntConstantTile(-2147483648,6,6),Extent(0.0, 0.0, 3.0, 3.0))scala> target.merge(r1).merge(r2).asciiDraw()res28: String =""    ND    ND     2     2     2     2    ND    ND     2     2     2     2     1     1     1     1     2     2     1     1     1     1     2     2     1     1     1     1    ND    ND     1     1     1     1    ND    ND_„ñ```",1/20/16,1
owcm,"Thanks echeipesh, is the approach easier if I already have an RDD of tiles?   I my processing I do create an RDD of the tiles to accomplish another task.",1/20/16,1
echeipesh,That_„Žs actually the case we were creating this feature to support. You can use these: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/merge/TileRDDMergeMethods.scala,1/20/16,1
echeipesh,Those assume you have already gone through tiling and need to merge RDDs post fact. If you_„Žre doing this all as one still you can just union your RDDs together before the tiling step and the merge will happen automatically.,1/20/16,1

echeipesh,I am essentially reducing a set of tiles to a single tile.,1/20/16,1

pomadchin,"ye, a good point ",1/27/16,1
echeipesh,Of course one problem is that they_„Žre both case classes.,1/27/16,1
pomadchin,actually I had some experiments with that ,1/27/16,1

schBen,"Hi again! How should I best create a multiband RDD like RDD[(SpatialKey, MultiBandTile)] of two singleband GeoTiffs that represent Landsat bands?

echeipesh,"You can join the two RDDs and map over the result to produce the `MultiBandTile` something like:```scalarddBandA.join(rddBandB).mapValues { case (tile1, tile2) => ArrayMultiBandTile(tile1, tile2) }```",1/28/16,1

jasonbeverage,Will that actually import all 3 bands into accumulo or just the first?,1/28/16,1

jasonbeverage,I'm looking at the geotrellis-ec2-cluster project to setup a cluster on AWS and I'm looking to increase the space allocated for hdfs,2/1/16,1
jasonbeverage,"I've got 1 leader and 4 followers, and I see that hadoop fs -ls is only reporting ~20GB of space available.",2/1/16,1
jasonbeverage,The followers look like they have a bunch of potential mount points at media/ephemeral{0-7},2/1/16,1
jasonbeverage,Do I need to manually create ebs volumes and attach those to the followers to give hdfs more space?,2/1/16,1
lossyrob,"@jasonbeverage  what instances? if you_„Žre using the geotrellis-ec2-cluster stuff, it should automatically mount the available ephemeral storage to the mount points you mentioned. And should show up in your hdfs ui",2/1/16,1
lossyrob,with spark you have to specifically pass in the dirs into th spark-submit command,2/1/16,1
lossyrob,"e.g. `--conf spark.executorEnv.SPARK_LOCAL_DIRS=""/media/ephemeral0,/media/ephemeral1_„`",2/1/16,1
jasonbeverage,"I configured it use a c4.large, I'm thinking that is the problem.",2/1/16,1

jasonbeverage,"So myfile.tif isn't on hdfs, it's just local.  It worked fine, but is the reason that it worked just b/c all of my virtual machines have the same /vagrant directory mounted or will hadoop somehow allow you to work with local files as well?",2/1/16,1
jasonbeverage,"I also copied over some data to hdfs and was able to do an import from hdfs has well, just by dropping the file:/ and giving the hdfs path.",2/1/16,1
lossyrob,"yeah, thank @hectcastro and @notthatbreezy for that :)",2/1/16,1
lossyrob,HDFS works with local files,2/1/16,1
lossyrob,the `file:` or `hdfs` (or even `s3n` or `s3a`) prefixes determing the file system type,2/1/16,1
lossyrob,so it_„Žs really the Hadoop IO API,2/1/16,1

jasonbeverage,"Ok, one more question and I will leave you alone for the day :)",2/1/16,1

lossyrob,(vieweing it as raw instead of markdown would make a little more sense),2/1/16,1
jasonbeverage,When I first tried to do an ingest on a large image (I'm just playing with the bluemarble geotiff right now to test) the ingest failed b/c it said it was too big.,2/1/16,1
jasonbeverage,So I used gdal-retile to chop it up into smaller chunks like some of the examples mentioned.,2/1/16,1
jasonbeverage,"And I didn't realize that I could just point to the directory of tiles as the ""path"" parameter.  Is that just taking those tiles and creating a virtual raster source from them?",2/1/16,1
jasonbeverage,Is it expecting to have a naming scheme with columns and rows that gdalretile dumps out or could I stick any random geotiffs in a directory and point to it as input?,2/1/16,1
kevinzau,"@pomadchin Hi, I'm working on getting OSM data using GeoWave/GeoMesa. Rob mentioned you had a Docker with both. Is it possible I could use it / where would I find it?",2/1/16,1
lossyrob,"@jasonbeverage it just does a recursive listing of the files in the directory, and takes things that match the tiff extension(s)",2/1/16,1
lossyrob,and so the input RDD is a collection of those rasters,2/1/16,1
lossyrob,"If you specify one image as the path, then the source _„ñtiles_„ is an RDD with one element, the single GeoTiff you_„Žre passing in",2/1/16,1
lossyrob,"but if it_„Žs a directory, its an RDD with as many elements as there are geotiffs in the directory",2/1/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Ok, and when it goes to ingest that list of rdds as a whole it tiles them up a single dataset right?",2/1/16,1
jasonbeverage,Kind of like how you could use gdalbuildvrt to create a virtual mosaic of a directory of files.,2/1/16,1
lossyrob,"not a list of RDDs, but an RDD of tiles (an RDD is like a list)",2/1/16,1
lossyrob,"it_„Žs a bit like VRT. but VRTs you kind of consider one image, you can pass into something that should take only one image",2/1/16,1
lossyrob,RDDs of tiles we always consider as a collection of tiles,2/1/16,1
lossyrob,that_„Žs sort of just an algorithmic difference,2/1/16,1
lossyrob,"but so if we have our source tiles in an RDD, potentially overlapping, and want to cut the tiles to another layout (say TMS Web Mercator to serve out onto a web map), then that_„Žs an operation that happens on the source RDD that converts it to an indexed tile set RDD, which you can save off into one of our backends",2/1/16,1
lossyrob,"So a source tile set is a key-value RDD where the key is something like a `ProjectedExtent` or `SpaceTimeInputKey`, where the key information has things like the Extent, the CRS, and the time.",2/1/16,1
lossyrob,"The indexed tiled set is `SpatialKey` or `SpaceTimeKey`, which has tile coordinates like `SpatialKey(123,32)`, and potentially time if your dealing with time-based tiles",2/1/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Ok, things are starting to become a little clearer now.",2/1/16,1
lossyrob,awesome,2/1/16,1
jasonbeverage,"So when you tile up an input you really are creating different ""rasters"" at different zoom levels",2/1/16,1
lossyrob,yup,2/1/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Which is why I can see that I have LayerIds like LayerId(""layer"", 0) and LayerId(""layer"", 1) etc.",2/1/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Ok, very cool.",2/1/16,1
lossyrob,exactly,2/1/16,1
lossyrob,so the zoom levels have meaning when you_„Žre using ZoomedLayoutScheme,2/1/16,1
jasonbeverage,Yeah right.,2/1/16,1
lossyrob,"There is also FloatingLayoutScheme, which just taked the native resolution and CRS, and cuts it up into tiles of a uniform size",2/1/16,1
lossyrob,then we just call it zoom 0,2/1/16,1
lossyrob,"I_„Žm not super psyched on zoom being there even if it has little meaning, but that might be a design choice from the past we will live with through 0.10 :)",2/1/16,1
jasonbeverage,"So if you wanted to provide a service using geotrellis  where you could take a dataset and view it interactively, but also wanted to be able to do some numerical calculations on the dataset at full resolution you could still use the tiled layout.",2/1/16,1
lossyrob,exactly!,2/1/16,1
jasonbeverage,and if you needed to work at the full resolution you'd just use the highest resolution zoom level.,2/1/16,1
lossyrob,so we would do the tms zoomed web mercator tiles for the visual stuff,2/1/16,1
jasonbeverage,So do you have any support for sparse tilesets?,2/1/16,1
lossyrob,"but if we want accuracy, keep it in it_„Žs native resolution and CRS, and do aggregate computations, say averages over polygons, on that set",2/1/16,1
lossyrob,it all should work with sparse data sets,2/1/16,1
lossyrob,"the tile layout will be for a full coverage of the dense space, but you_„Žll only have keys for the tiles you have",2/1/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Ok, they will just have missing tiles then where there is no data.",2/1/16,1
jasonbeverage,Yeah ok.,2/1/16,1
jasonbeverage,The tiles as rasters is a really neat abstraction.,2/1/16,1
jasonbeverage,So you can work with tiled datasets in the same way as you could with a full raster.,2/1/16,1
lossyrob,"thanks :) it_„Žs been a couple of years in the making, I think it_„Žs converging on something really generally useful",2/1/16,1
lossyrob,yeah. and the code for working with a set that has just one tile looks the same as a giant set that you_„Žd have to run on a cluster with many nodes. so its a nice abstraction over interfacing with small and large datasets,2/1/16,1
jasonbeverage,Yeah very cool.,2/1/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Thanks again for your help, I'm doing an ingest on an aws cluster now.  Will let you know how it goes :)",2/1/16,1

pomadchin,:+1: ,2/2/16,1
moradology,hey all: trying to get a sense of people's feelings on the question of nodata and its relationship to color specification when rendering a tile as png or jpg,2/3/16,1
moradology,"currently, nodata is not really a part of the colorbreaks object. instead, a nodatacolor is fed in as a part of the call to, for instance, `.renderPng`",2/3/16,1
moradology,"it's a bit unclear to me why that makes more sense than putting it on the breaks object. yes, it is an exceptional case, in that it is always only one value rather than a true 'break', but it also seems as though we should have a single something-or-other on which we specify the colors that a rendering should use",2/3/16,1
kevinzau,@pomadchin Thanks!,2/3/16,1
lossyrob,"@moradology to clarify my position on this: As it currently stands, ColorBreaks is a composition of two arrays: the breaks and the colors. This is a funky API and should be changed. As it stands, NODATA being part of those 2 arrays seems not right to me. NODATA color being part of the _„ñColorBreaks_„, if by _„ñColorBreaks_„ it means the thing that holds the information about how to color the raster, then yes I think it should be a part of it. Even the name, _„ñColor Breaks_„, implies some sort of breaking the range of values up and coloring those ranges. NODATA sort of exists outside of that. This is all to say, I think your intuition that there should be a thing that tells you how to color the raster, and it should account for the color ramp, the quantile breaks, and how you_„Žd like to color NODATA. I just don_„Žt think our current representation of ColorBreaks has the correct view of the thing that you want NODATA to be a of.",2/3/16,1
moradology,whew. awesome. i definitely misunderstood your position on this,2/3/16,1
pomadchin,"@moradology @lossyrob can we define now a custom nodata value for a tile during it_„Žs rendering as png?sometimes it needs to be to colorised and somitimes to be transparent",2/3/16,1
moradology,"yeah, we can do that now - the question is just more about where and how that should be done",2/3/16,1
lossyrob,"@moradology cool. thanks for bringing it up. I am interested in hearing what other people have to say about how the coloring/rendering API can be most useful, so if you have an opinion at all please pipe up!",2/3/16,1
moradology,"the notion of a 'break' is just an upper or lower (at this point, i think almost universally upper) bound on values which get a specified color",2/3/16,1
lossyrob,"yeah, which makes it fast in the implementation, because we_„Žre just doing a search through a sortd array that breaks on a value whenever a bound is found",2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,So I'm trying to do an ingest directly from s3 using an s3a path and it appears to be getting hung.,2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,I'm doing something like this:,2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,"spark-submit \  --class geotrellis.chatta.ChattaIngest --driver-memory=2G $JAR \  --input hadoop --format geotiff --cache NONE -I path=""s3a://mybucket/mytifs"" \  --output accumulo -O instance=$INSTANCE table=$TABLE user=$USER password=$PASSWORD zookeeper=$ZOOKEEPER \  --layer mylayer --pyramid --crs $CRS --layoutScheme $LAYOUT_SCHEME",2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,"I only have one file in there, and it finds it, but then the last line I see when I run spark-submit is like this:",2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,16/02/03 18:08:31 INFO rdd.NewHadoopRDD: Input split: s3a://mybucket/mytifs/bluemarble_merc_small.tif:0+8428551,2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,And it's just hung there.  Any ideas?  I have the IAM role setup and can use s3a via the hadoop fs commands and it all appears to work.,2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Ok perhaps I'm wrong, it looks like it worked, it just hung for a very long time on that file before it did anything.  It's just a single 8mb tif so I expected it to just blaze through.",2/3/16,1
echeipesh,@jasonbeverage: we_„Žve seen hadoop S3 implemintations do all manner of funky things that often manifests as unusually long delays in listing. We made our own S3 format to have more controll of the matter. You can use that spark submit but change input section to `_„îinput s3 _„îformat geotiff -I bucket=mybucket key=mytifs` and it should work more predictably.,2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,Thanks @echeipesh .  Where do I set my credentials for that to work?,2/3/16,1
echeipesh,"That uses the aws s3 java client, so the usual places should work.",2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Ok thanks, I'll look into that.",2/3/16,1
echeipesh,relevant docs: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSdkDocsJava/latest/DeveloperGuide/credentials.html,2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Perfect, thanks.  That's what I was looking at.",2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,I assume that I'd need to set the credentials on all of the nodes in the cluster right?  And not just on the leader.,2/3/16,1
echeipesh,Actually just the leader. We will include the resolved token in the generated hadoop slits which get shipped to the workers.,2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,Ok great.,2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,And that doesn't work with IAM roles out of the box right?,2/3/16,1
echeipesh,"An even better production way to do it is to setup IAM roles, this is something that S3 Input Format will check.",2/3/16,1
echeipesh,"It does, thats the other reason we wrote it. Hadoop s3 client specifically ignores IAM roles, requeiring keys in hdfs-site.xml",2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Yeah ok, I have an IAM role setup, but it didn't appear to work with the --input s3",2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Which I why I looked at the s3a file system, which did appear to work with iam roles.",2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,"maybe it's not an IAM role issue, I'm getting an exception like this:",2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Exception in thread ""main"" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/joda/time/DateTimeZone	at com.amazonaws.auth.InstanceProfileCredentialsProvider.loadCredentials(InstanceProfileCredentialsProvider.java:166)	at com.amazonaws.auth.InstanceProfileCredentialsProvider.getCredentials(InstanceProfileCredentialsProvider.java:72)	at com.amazonaws.auth.AWSCredentialsProviderChain.getCredentials(AWSCredentialsProviderChain.java:101)",2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,So perhaps I don't have that dependency included in my jar.,2/3/16,1
echeipesh,Odd that should be part of the assembly,2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,It's highly possible that I did something wrong when building my ingest assembly.  I started from @pomadchin spark version of the chatta demo and used that ingest command.,2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Very likely I'm doing something wrong, I'm very new to geotrellis and scala in general :)",2/3/16,1
pomadchin,"@jasonbeverage yo! I am sure, I tried absolutely clean environment to prevent dependency issues (my local artefacts) ",2/3/16,1
pomadchin,O:,2/3/16,1
pomadchin,so this error appears in chatta-demo project?,2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,"I'm not using your project directly, I created my own test project based on yours.",2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,"So in theory I should be able to get the geotrellis code, run publish-local.sh to build and copy over the jars, and then use your project and run ./sbt assembly to create a working assembly right?",2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,"I don't see org.joda.time included anywhere in your dependencies, should I have to add that manually or does it automatically get picked up from somewhere?",2/3/16,1
pomadchin,"you can try, but this err seems weird",2/3/16,1
pomadchin,"i haven_„Žt tried to make S3 ingest, and with Accumulo there was no such error",2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Yeah, I only get it when I'm doing anything with s3",2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,Going from a local file or from hdfs into Accumulo works fine.,2/3/16,1
pomadchin,I think that there _may be_ joda time versions issues,2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,"This is a very old change, but I see here where some joda jars were removed and jets3t jars were added:  https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis-ec2-cluster/commit/aa8fc272908baf5317071cce0101614aec5edb0c",2/3/16,1
pomadchin,"we use `""com.github.nscala-time"" %% ""nscala-time"" % _„ñ2.6.0""`",2/3/16,1
pomadchin,"hm, dunno mb that_„Žs an issue where you pointed ._.",2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Yeah like I said, I'm not very familiar with scala, so I'm a bit lost when issues like this come up :)  ",2/3/16,1
pomadchin,"think yes, there can be also a difference in joda time version used in geotrellis and used in aws client",2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,That might very well be it.,2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,So is com.github.nscala-time some replacement for joda time?,2/3/16,1
pomadchin,it_„Žs a wrapper for joda time,2/3/16,1
pomadchin,"so you can try to find out what joda time version used in aws client, exclude it from geotrellis, and to add as a dep explicitly of a necessary version",2/3/16,1
pomadchin,it seems like they use `2.8.1`,2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Ok, thanks.  I'll give that a try.",2/3/16,1
lossyrob,@jasonbeverage I hit some dependency troubles along these lines at some point,2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,And it looks like nscala-time 2.6.0 is using joda-time 2.9.1,2/3/16,1
lossyrob,https://github.com/lossyrob/geotrellis-ec2-cluster/tree/2016-01-demo,2/3/16,1
lossyrob,I_„Žve been working off of a branch,2/3/16,1
lossyrob,not sure this is the same issue,2/3/16,1
lossyrob,"but what can happen is, Hadoop jars conflict version wise with what_„Žs in the assembly",2/3/16,1
lossyrob,and spark needs all the supplied hadoop jars to function,2/3/16,1
lossyrob,so doing things like this https://github.com/lossyrob/geotrellis-ec2-cluster/commit/04ef2a2999f12a78b5e8f1361e5a12de377c6ce3#diff-337ff348629489ac63a3a62f0b4291b1R10,2/3/16,1
lossyrob,but I thought we deleted Joda out a while ago,2/3/16,1
lossyrob,it might be the conflict with the AWS sdk,2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,I saw that change was way back at the beginning of 2015,2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,"I also installed awscli on the leader, I wouldn't expect that to mess with anything but you never know.",2/3/16,1
lossyrob,https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/amazonaws/aws-java-sdk/1.7.4/aws-java-sdk-1.7.4.pom,2/3/16,1
lossyrob,"the aws sdk that is in the hadoop client jars is way old, and conflicts with the one we are using, and the joda we are using with it",2/3/16,1
lossyrob,"so, unfortunately_„_I think the solution is to build new AMI_„Žs off of my branch",2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,Yeah no worries.,2/3/16,1
lossyrob,another path you can take is to use EMR,2/3/16,1
lossyrob,"if I_„Žm not using Accumulo, I always go with EMR",2/3/16,1
lossyrob,because of stuff like this :),2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,At least I know now that your branch even exists and I should be looking at that :),2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,I'm specifically looking at Accumulo right now so the geotrellis-ec2-cluster project has been very helpful.,2/3/16,1
lossyrob,"yeah, I_„Žve been meaning to get to merging those changes. gotta catch up with that",2/3/16,1
lossyrob,oh gotcha,2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,"I've also not done anything with EMR yet, but would definitely be interested in checking it out.   Is there a geotrellis EMR quickstart somewhere?",2/3/16,1
lossyrob,this is a project that I_„Žve been using to do PySpark reprojection of tiles on EMR against S3. It would start an EMR cluster taht you could also use to run an uploaded scala jar: https://github.com/lossyrob/emr-reproject,2/3/16,1
lossyrob,"One of the things I am working on (in the midst of all the other things, of course) is a tutorial for grabbing and doing operations on landsat, that will show how to do that using EMR and also the cluster stuff. So this stuff is currently being worked out in documented form",2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Awesome, thanks for the pointers.",2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,"I'll try your branch and see how it goes, and then also check out your emr project.",2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Also I noticed that my AMI's had aws-java-sdk-1.7.14.jar, not aws-java-sdk-1.7.4.jar",2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,don't know if that was a typo in your roles or if something was different for me for some reason.,2/3/16,1
lossyrob,"hm, not sure. Hopefully that doesn_„Žt make that step fail to clear out those jars",2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,Rob you're the man.  I deleted those jars and it looks like it's working now.,2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,"No more exception, and that little 8mb tile test worked.",2/3/16,1
lossyrob,nice!,2/3/16,1
pomadchin,cool,2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,"I'm trying the same ingest on a bunch of bluemarble tiles I made, it appears to be working but does seem to be chugging along pretty slowly.",2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,Just based on how much output spark-submit is giving me.,2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,I tried the same import against the tiles copied into hdfs and it seemed pretty fast.,2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,"I've got plenty to play with now though, thanks again for your help!",2/3/16,1
lossyrob,"not sure about the speed; HDFS is always going to be faster (since it_„Žs on disk/on the worker node that is doing the computation), but I haven_„Žt found that it_„Žs *too* much slower",2/3/16,1
lossyrob,There_„Žs the _„ñsplitSize_„ argument in spark-etl that controls how many tiles are being pulled down per partition. might want to play around with that,2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Ok, I wonder if that has anything to do with it.",2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,I'm not setting it and I've got like ~4K tiles,2/3/16,1
lossyrob,"not sure what it defaults to, @echeipesh would know better",2/3/16,1
lossyrob,"but that_„Žs a point of contention for me usually_„_.I want to bring down tiles in large groups because that_„Žs faster access to S3, but also I don_„Žt want my partitions to be too large or else I_„Žll get out of memory during tiling",2/3/16,1
lossyrob,so one thing (inside a manual ingest) is pull down 100 tiles at a time and then repartition to some magic number,2/3/16,1
lossyrob,still working out how we can make that more configurable/less of guess work,2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Ha, you lost me at repartition :)",2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,I'll dig into the split size and see if I can understand what might be a good number.  ,2/3/16,1
lossyrob,ah gotcha,2/3/16,1
echeipesh,"If not specified it_„Žll use the aws SDK default for key listing, which is 1000 keys.",2/3/16,1
lossyrob,"ok. jeesh, that_„Žll do it",2/3/16,1
lossyrob,so you have 4 big partitions,2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Yeah, and it's like 13GB of imagery.",2/3/16,1
lossyrob,"so that makes sense. bring that down a ways, maybe 50?",2/3/16,1
echeipesh,We haven_„Žt looked at that part for a while. Do you think we should do something like a sample and guess at optimal partition sizes ?,2/3/16,1
lossyrob,"yeah, or maybe guess a bit lower. Shouldn_„Žt we be using the default partition number to check it out? We know the total estimate number of elements because of the client call, or no?",2/3/16,1
lossyrob,yeah because we bin it_„_so we should at least bin to default partitions (so it wouldn_„Žt be 4 in this case),2/3/16,1
echeipesh,Not sure why this is the first time I_„Žm thinking this _„_ but we know the size of the keys when we list them. So we can do a really good job of keeping partition size good without any extra interactions with S3.,2/3/16,1
lossyrob,the assumption we have to make/allow control over is the size of the data elements,2/3/16,1
lossyrob,"but if we just assume some defaults that are ok, I think we_„Žd avoid the problems that @jasonbeverage is having",2/3/16,1
echeipesh,"Yep. We_„Žre going to be off by some constant factor that accounts for compression ratio. But other than that number of bits in and out should be the same, regardless of how we tile it.",2/3/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Ok, with splitSize 50 it's at least moving along now.",2/3/16,1
lossyrob,a good thing to target is to have task completion at around 500ms.,2/3/16,1
lossyrob,"That_„Žs ideal, and I usually don_„Žt get that with ingests",2/3/16,1
lossyrob,"I do with operations on ingested data, though",2/3/16,1
lossyrob,but just a good thing to note as a target,2/3/16,1
echeipesh,"I_„Žve heard that given, what is the reasoning behind 500ms ?",2/3/16,1
lossyrob,"Well, mainly because that_„Žs the what the databricks peoples said :)",2/3/16,1
echeipesh,"Let it be written, let it be said :)",2/3/16,1
lossyrob,"but i think it has to do with maximizing parallelization, while not having tasks too fast that the scheduling causes inefficiency",2/3/16,1
lossyrob,and it_„Žs a rule of thumb that seems to have worked on brining down execution times for me,2/3/16,1
echeipesh,balance between parallelism and scheduler thrashing makes sense to me,2/3/16,1

jasonbeverage,spark-shell --conf spark.dynamicAllocation.minExecutors=1 --conf spark.dynamicAllocation.initialExecutors=2 --conf spark.dynamicAllocation.maxExecutors=2 --conf spark.dynamicAllocation.sustainedSchedulerBacklogTimeout=120 --conf spark.dynamicAllocation.schedulerBacklogTimeout=300 --conf spark.dynamicAllocation.executorIdleTimeout=60 --executor-memory 512m --master mesos://zk://zookeeper.service.geotrellis-spark.internal:2181/mesos,2/5/16,1
jasonbeverage,I'm still super new to spark so lots of that is gibberish to me :),2/5/16,1
jasonbeverage,But the gist I got from that bug report is that something is wrong with 1.5 with related to the # of executors.  You have to specify them up front with minExecutors < initialExecutors < maxExecutors,2/5/16,1
jasonbeverage,This is the actual bug report:  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-10790,2/5/16,1
lossyrob,this is good stuff. so your saying that `spark-shell --master mesos://zk://zookeeper.service.geotrellis-spark.internal:2181/mesos` is failing to allocate any resources,2/5/16,1
jasonbeverage,Yeah exactly.,2/5/16,1
lossyrob,which shouldn_„Žt use dynamic allocation,2/5/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Once you run  distData.filter(_< 10).collect() it just keeps dumping out that ""Initial job has not accepted any resources; check your cluster UI to ensure that workers are registered and have sufficient resources"" message",2/5/16,1
lossyrob,"well, usually I set the executors explicitly in a spark submit call",2/5/16,1
lossyrob,you have a cluster up and running?,2/5/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Yeah I should, one sec.  Let me hop on my other machine.",2/5/16,1
jasonbeverage,Yeah it's up.,2/5/16,1
lossyrob,i feel like this should be working,2/5/16,1

jasonbeverage,I'm just doing a vagrant up now.,2/5/16,1
lossyrob,oh oh,2/5/16,1
lossyrob,gotcha. nevermind,2/5/16,1
lossyrob,don_„Žt try to run that :),2/5/16,1
jasonbeverage,So just make those #'s smaller probably :),2/5/16,1
lossyrob,a lot smaller,2/5/16,1
lossyrob,ha,2/5/16,1
lossyrob,but i think coarse mode is default,2/5/16,1
lossyrob,and the other stuff talks about the driver,2/5/16,1
lossyrob,so I_„Žm not sure_„_I_„Žm pretty sure I was successfuly runing a shell on an AWS cluster using this branch,2/5/16,1
lossyrob,without having to do dynamic allocation,2/5/16,1
lossyrob,something to test against next time I have one fired up for sure,2/5/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Yeah like I said, very new to spark so not sure where the issues actually are :)",2/5/16,1
jasonbeverage,let me try just specifying the resources up front like you showed.,2/5/16,1
lossyrob,well way to hunt down the issue and get a workaround at least,2/5/16,1
jasonbeverage,I don't know spark but I'm good at google.  Counts for something :),2/5/16,1
lossyrob,"that issue is fixed in 1.5.2, problem is we rely on cloudera ditros of spark",2/5/16,1
lossyrob,haha,2/5/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Yeah right, I saw that.",2/5/16,1
jasonbeverage,So mesos reports 4 available cores and 2gb of memory available.,2/5/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Ok, so your command worked fine.",2/5/16,1
jasonbeverage,With reduced values of course.,2/5/16,1
lossyrob,"i wonder how many executors, or what the executor memory it wants is. Because if mesos tries to schedule a spark executor, and it wants more memory than available in that slot, it won_„Žt schedule it",2/5/16,1
lossyrob,and you_„Žll see that behavior,2/5/16,1
jasonbeverage,Yeah that's what I'm thinking.  I wonder what the defaults are.,2/5/16,1
lossyrob,usually I specify everything explicitly based on the instances I have,2/5/16,1
lossyrob,"not sure, but that might be the trick",2/5/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Yeah don't know, I requested 16 cores (which I obviously don't have) and it still worked.",2/5/16,1
jasonbeverage,It might just be an issue of setting *something*,2/5/16,1
lossyrob,"yeah. If you request 16, and it can give you 4, it_„Žll give you 4. But if you request 4, and each of those 4 needs more memory then mesos is willing to give 1, then it_„Žll schedule none",2/5/16,1
lossyrob,I also get confused between mesos and yarn because I_„Žve debugged these issues on both and can_„Žt keep straight what system needs what,2/5/16,1
lossyrob,"YARN we use on EMR, and also some docker containers that @pomadchin_„Žs working on",2/5/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Ok, so just trying a couple of things.  It looks like it's the memory",2/5/16,1
jasonbeverage,"If I don't specify a spark.driver.memory and the spark.executor.memory then I get that ""Initial job has not accepted any resources; check your cluster UI to ensure that workers are registered and have sufficient resources"" issue.",2/5/16,1
jasonbeverage,Easy enough workaround.,2/5/16,1
lossyrob,"yeah, something is going on with the defaults. What are you setting it to? We_„Žll have to update the README",2/5/16,1
jasonbeverage,cores=2 and 512m for both the executor and driver works.,2/5/16,1
jasonbeverage,4 cores also works.,2/5/16,1
jasonbeverage,So will cores = the number of executors then?,2/5/16,1
jasonbeverage,So 4 executors at 512 each should be the limit with the amount of memory allocated by default.,2/5/16,1
lossyrob,cores are how many cores are given to ach executor,2/5/16,1
lossyrob,"so if you have 1 node with 4 cores, and you set cores=1, then there will be 4 executors per node",2/5/16,1
jasonbeverage,And each executor will have 512mb (or whatever you specified) mb of ram available.,2/5/16,1
lossyrob,"yeah. so if you have 512mb, 1 core, then the node will want 2048mb for executor usage. If you have 2 core, it_„Žll need 1024 for executor usage",2/5/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Oh, so if you don't specify the number of executors will it just use all that is available?",2/5/16,1
jasonbeverage,Or I'm sure there is some default for the # of executors.,2/5/16,1
lossyrob,"Well, with coarse grained mode Mesos, I would expect the # of executors to default to the number of nodes. But I_„Žm not totally sure TBH",2/5/16,1

jasonbeverage,"Spark question for you gurus.  Specifically about the spark-version of the chatta demo from @pomadchin.I get that the ingest code is ran with spark-submit, it just runs the code and when it's done it exists.  But the code that actually serves up the imagery just works using ./sbt run without using spark-submit.  It just creates a SparkContext internally and it works.So I suppose that is my question, what is the difference between running code with spark-submit and running code using sbt run or java -cp that just creates a SparkContext?",2/10/16,1
pomadchin,"the problem in an sbt run that actually you have not a result jar, so using this mode you can_„Žt run you code ditributed; the correct way to run spark code is to build an assembly and to ingest it using spark-submit / or as a standalone jar",2/10/16,1
pomadchin,"here you can find example of chatta demo on a cluster: https://github.com/pomadchin/geo-env/blob/master/install/geotrellis/run-server.sh",2/10/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Yeah that's a fine distinction, I did something similar.  I built an assembly jar that contained some code to serve up tiles.  Just running it with java -cp worked fine, but I got some akka errors I didn't understand when I tried to run spark-submit on it.",2/10/16,1
jasonbeverage,So is there a difference between running the assembly using spark-submit or java -cp?,2/10/16,1
pomadchin,"also ye ._. there is differenceso spark-submit takes your jar and send it to other spark nodes, though when you have a fat assembly jar and start it using java -cp, it should become a driver node (as i understand), so you should worry about libs versions and be creful with data serializationthink that cool guyz in channel will correct my thoughts ",2/10/16,1
jasonbeverage,Hmm ok.,2/10/16,1
jasonbeverage,"So spark-submit will help you out with copying the jars around to the nodes if needed.  With java -cp it sounds like it might work, but you have to be careful.",2/10/16,1
pomadchin,"so as i think, the _„ñright way_„ to start geotrellis chatta server using java -cp (cuase it just stays as a process and you dont care about it); and there is no difference how to start an ingest process, cause in fact it is a job",2/10/16,1
jasonbeverage,"right, the ingest starts and finishes so it's just a one off thing.",2/10/16,1
pomadchin,(: ideally _„î docker container with server :D so you can just make `docker restart gt-server` if smth went wrong,2/10/16,1

owcm,@lossyrob Interesting enough I can read the drive of hdfs and open it up fine in a tool like qgis,2/17/16,1

lossyrob,can you write it without compression and see if that works?,2/17/16,1
lossyrob,"If so, it would be great to get a hold of the geotiff, that way I could make a unit test to prove that the deflate writing writes something that the reader can_„Žt read.",2/17/16,1
owcm,@lossyrob  I look at the GeoTiff and SingleBandGeoTiff write methods and I don't see a compression flag.   I see the option to read compressed or uncompressed when reading a Array[byte] into  SingleBandGeoTiff.,2/17/16,1
lossyrob,"ok. So you have read this in from a GeoTiff compressed, did some things to it, then wrote it out, then tried to read it back in?",2/17/16,1
owcm,"Sorry not very clear, always read in as SingleBandGeoTiff, I am only dealing with Single Band Geotiffs.  Do my operations and write out usually with  SingleBandGeoTiff write operation. Noticed in one case I wrote out using the GeoTiff object write operation.",2/17/16,1
owcm,Wondered if that could be the source of my conflict.,2/17/16,1
lossyrob,no worries about the single band. So you can read in a geotiff either uncompressed or compressed,2/17/16,1
lossyrob,do you use `SingelBandGeoTiff.compressed(_„_)`,2/17/16,1
lossyrob,to read it in,2/17/16,1
lossyrob,initially,2/17/16,1
lossyrob,or set the compressed flag to true,2/17/16,1
owcm,Okay I saw the flag option.  Have usually gone with the default which I believe is false.   When I started getting these errors I tried reading as compresses and uncompressed.  If your interested I can send you the file.  Not sure how deep you wanted to get dragged in.,2/17/16,1
lossyrob,I just want to figure out if it_„Žs a geotrellis bug. Because then it needs to get fixed before the release,2/17/16,1
lossyrob,so the exception is thrown when you read it in with the default? or read it in compressed? or both?,2/17/16,1
lossyrob,and when I say read it in,2/17/16,1
lossyrob,I mean the original raster,2/17/16,1
lossyrob,"so you read in a geotiff A, and modify it, then write out geotiff B, then try to read geotiff B, and then get the exception. That_„Žs the scenario right?",2/17/16,1
owcm,"Correct, and I receive it when using either compression option.",2/17/16,1
lossyrob,"ok, that_„Žs good to know",2/17/16,1

lossyrob,yes,2/17/16,1

lossyrob,"meaning, if we_„Žre indexing the tiles with the same SFC configured the same way, then it_„Žs really beneficial to have them in the same table, especially if you_„Žll be joining across them",2/17/16,1
lossyrob,though there is a bit of functionality that is pending to really make that story complete,2/17/16,1
jasonbeverage,Ok gotcha.  So if you had tons of data collected of the same site and you wanted to analyze them together you'd store them in the same table.  But if you had lots of collections all over the world you wouldn't want to store them in the same table.,2/17/16,1
lossyrob,"yeah, you can frame it as a table per indexed space, exactly",2/17/16,1

jamesmcclain,Or there could be another alternative that I have missed,2/18/16,1
echeipesh,You wouldn_„Žt be able to use reflection without refering to undefined types unfortunatly. ,2/18/16,1
jamesmcclain,What do you mean?  Is it not possible to inspect the rdd type to see if it has a method of the desired name (e.g. `saveToS3`)?,2/18/16,1
jamesmcclain,(Thinking about e.g. line 55 of the file that I linked to),2/18/16,1
echeipesh,thats an extension method: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/00f0f342fc95da35fb489e727416f3d5c78086d8/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/io/s3/SaveToS3Methods.scala,2/18/16,1
jamesmcclain,"Yeah, I am aware of that.   I haven't experimented, but I assume that if the correct implicit class has been imported, reflection should discover the methods",2/18/16,1
jamesmcclain,"My understanding is that under covers, methods added by implicit classes are handled the same way normal methods are",2/18/16,1
dwins,"no, an implicit class works by having the compiler insert calls to a method everywhere the extension methods are used",2/18/16,1
echeipesh,"Not sure actually, but I wouldn_„Žt expect that.",2/18/16,1
jamesmcclain,Whether they are present or not is a function of importing and linking?,2/18/16,1
dwins,x.extensionMethod ==> addExtensions(x).extensionMethod,2/18/16,1
jamesmcclain,"Ahh, I see",2/18/16,1
jamesmcclain,So under the covers they are not actually methods of the type that they appear to be?,2/18/16,1
dwins,where addExtensions is just a method that calls the appropriate constructor (actually for implicit classes it will have the same name as the class),2/18/16,1
echeipesh,"There are two options here: 1) to type class this out, 2) to use SPI https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/ext/basics/spi.html 3) change the API",2/18/16,1
jamesmcclain,"Okay, I'll explore those possibilities",2/18/16,1
echeipesh,"@lossyrob should chime in, but I would lean to change API to something like: `rdd.renderAsPng(_„ñs3://bucket/layer/{x}.{y}.{z.}.png_„): RDD[(String, Array[Byte]` and then having having someth ing like `.saveToHadoop` or `.saveToS3` being extension methods on that.",2/18/16,1
echeipesh,"That takes aways the automatic replacement of hadoop s3 implemintation with ours, but I don_„Žt think that_„Žs a huge deal.",2/18/16,1

lossyrob,I like that option.,2/18/16,1

lossyrob,just,2/18/16,1
lossyrob,"`RDD[(K, Png)]`",2/18/16,1

pomadchin,publish local will publish only scala 2.10 version artefacts as the default target is scala 2.10 due to default spark default distributions,2/19/16,1
lossyrob,@owcm you could do that witha focal operation that paints the cell a certain color (or marks it with a certain value) based on if the value of anything in that neighborhood matches the criteria,2/19/16,1

pomadchin,:tada: green travis :tada:,2/20/16,1
owcm,"@lossyrob I was able to follow your lead and read the points from a tiled RasterRDD.  Working in a single raster environment I am ableto take a sequence of points and using VectorToRaster.rasterize(points,re, <some value> ) to merge them into a single raster.Something like ``` val points = Seq(  Point(re.gridToMap(100,100)).buffer(30),  Point(re.gridToMap(200,200)).buffer(30),  Point(re.gridToMap(300,300)).buffer(30),  Point(re.gridToMap(400,400)).buffer(30),  Point(re.gridToMap(500,500)).buffer(30))val rpts:Tile = VectorToRaster.rasterize(points,re, 0x55)// Set background to values of 0var rptsCleaned: Tile = rpts.mapDouble { (col: Int, row: Int, z: Double) =>  var zz = z  if (z != 0x55) {    zz = 0  }  zz}// Create a GeoTiffval ptsGT = GeoTiff( rptsCleaned, obsExtent, obsCRS )// Create a Rastersource from Geotiff Pointsval fsNormalizedOutRS = RasterSource( fsNormalizedOut, obsExtent)val r1RS = RasterSource ( pstg., obsExtent )// Or in point data with existing Raster sourceval combinedRS:RasterSource = fsNormalizedOutRS.localOr( r1RS ```This works nicely in the single raster world.I followed  your example and read all of the points of interest out of a Tiled RDD collection of type RDD[ (ProjectedExtent, Tile) ] elements. So now I would like to take these points, buffer them like in the above example,  and OR them back into my original Tiled RDD[ (ProjectedExtent, Tile) ] collection.One thought was to create a single Tile the size of the Tiled RDD extent and populated it with my points.  Then run that Tile through the X/Y/Z Tiler and creating a second RDD collection that I can OR in with my original Tiled RDD collection. Does this sound like a valid approach?",2/22/16,1
lossyrob,"hmm_„_ if the point set is not going to be too large then I would just broadcast it to a task that takes the original tiles and the set of points and does something with them, rasterizes over the full tile and then creates a new tile taking into account whatever you need from the point data. Using a spatial index would speed that up a bit perhaps",2/22/16,1
lossyrob,"or from the RDD of point data assign a key to each point (or set of keys, they might overlap two tiles), and that way it_„Žs spatially partitioned, and then joining the point RDD to the tile RDD, and then creating your new tiles out of the combination of the points and tiles.",2/22/16,1

echeipesh,"speaking of weird things, does anybody have an explanation for this behavior in console:```scalaraster > console[info] Starting scala interpreter...[info] import geotrellis.raster._import geotrellis.raster.resample._import geotrellis.vector._Welcome to Scala version 2.10.5 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0_74).Type in expressions to have them evaluated.Type :help for more information.scala> CellType.fromString(""float32"")res0: geotrellis.raster.CellType = float32scala> CellType.fromString(""float32"")<console>:17: error: value fromString is not a member of object geotrellis.raster.CellType              CellType.fromString(""float32_„)```",2/23/16,1

echeipesh,"@lokifacio: LayoutScheme is really just a scheme for figuring out how to pick a TileLayout for a raster of specific extent and resolution. We have two options right now: `ZoomedLayoutScheme` that matches tile layout used by Leaflet and other slippy map clients and the one you found `FloatingLayoutScheme`. You_„Žve told it that you want your tiles to be 250x250 at whatever their resolution is, `RasterMetaData.fromRdd(_„_)` goes and collects the actual extent of the input data and figures out how many tiles of that size it would take to cover it. Tile (0,0) is going to perfectly match the upper left corner of your raster and it tiles from there. So in fact you can use `input_metadata` in place of `metadata`. You can then give this meta data to `cutToLayout` function that will retile the tiles to match the layout you_„Žve discovered/specified. ",2/23/16,1
echeipesh,Check out the example of `Ingest.scala` to see how that workflow works: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/ingest/Ingest.scala,2/23/16,1
echeipesh,One odd thing you may see is that reprojection happens after tiling. That allows the reprojection process to sample past the tile boundaries (since the tile layout is known) and produce a more accurate reprojection. If one used reproject on source tiles before tiling them the reproject function would be sampling some NoData values around tile boundaries.,2/23/16,1
rshirochenko,,2/24/16,1
rshirochenko,"> @rshirochenko also check out your fs.defaultFS value: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/io/accumulo/AccumuloWriteStrategy.scala#L32-L41Checked it out, and there are hdfs value. Seems that it likely related to defaultFS value, is it  possible to manually setup hdfs path for accumulo ingest script?",2/24/16,1
lossyrob,"@rshirochenko the default write path is what gets written to HDFS. Accumulo then ingests to there. That_„Žs a technique of ingesting into accumulo, where you write out to HDFS and tell accumulo where the table data is, and it synchronously absorbs the data into a table you specify",2/24/16,1
lossyrob,"if you use a relative path, it defaults to the default FS value",2/24/16,1
lossyrob,but you can supply your own FS in the path,2/24/16,1

lossyrob,wait I_„Žm speaking too soon. give me a minute,2/24/16,1
dwins,@lossyrob yes it came up while i was reading up on proj.4. it's one of the links on their wiki https://github.com/osgeo/proj.4/wiki#documentation-1,2/24/16,1
dwins,a couple of dead links there but some good info on the working ones,2/24/16,1
lossyrob,nice,2/24/16,1
lokifacio,so what's the correct way to reproject only some sub-extent using RasterRDD? (I suppose that the most efficient way is only resampling the area interest from the sourceCRS to my targetCRS),2/24/16,1
dwins,this is the one i found most approachable (good picture to text ratio :wink: ) http://www.progonos.com/furuti/MapProj/Normal/TOC/cartTOC.html ,2/24/16,1
lossyrob,@lokifacio ok a bit confused. When you uncomment the code do you change `val target = tiles.cutTiles(metadataTargetCRS)` to `val target = reprojected.cutTiles(metadataTargetCRS)`,2/24/16,1
lokifacio,but again not sure how to define that area properly? in which extent should I do it?,2/24/16,1
lossyrob,"so you want to take a raster layer and then crop it to some specific extent in the target CRS, yeah?",2/24/16,1

lokifacio,yep,2/24/16,1
lossyrob,"whoa, really?",2/24/16,1
lossyrob,so just running cut tiles somehow mutates the original tiles rdd?,2/24/16,1

lossyrob,"cutTiles actually cuts the tiles, but does not merge any overlaps",2/24/16,1

pomadchin,For accumulo we have to provide a new table written in header ,2/29/16,1
pomadchin,,2/29/16,1
pomadchin,basically we ne it for a generic layer copier,2/29/16,1
rshirochenko,"How to get tiles from layout and how to convert them to RasterRDD? Is it possible to read whole layer as RasterRDD? My code (this will return ContextRDD) :```implicit val _sc = scval accumulo_instance = AccumuloInstance(""test"",""localhost"",""root"", new PasswordToken(""zxczxc""))val attributeStore = new AccumuloAttributeStore(accumulo_instance.connector, ""attributes"")val reader = AccumuloLayerReader[SpatialKey,Tile,RasterMetaData](accumulo_instance)val layer1 = LayerId(""b1"", 12)val layer2 = LayerId(""b3"", 12)val readLayer1 = reader.read(layer1)val readLayer2 = reader.read(layer2)```",2/29/16,1
lossyrob,"@pomadchin the layer writer writes to the table, and writes the correct table in the metadata. In fact, if there was a new schema in the layer writer, that code would overwrite the correct schema with the older, incorrect one",2/29/16,1
lossyrob,I_„Žm pretty sure that code can be dropped,2/29/16,1
lossyrob,@rshirochenko that code looks correct to me,2/29/16,1
lossyrob,"it_„Žll read the whole `layer1` and `layer2` out as `ContextRDD`, which is really just a `RasterRDD[(SpatialKey, Tile)] with Metadata[RasterMetaData]`, which is in fact type aliased to `RasterRDD[SpatialKey]`. So you have what you need I think",2/29/16,1
pomadchin,"@lossyrob probably, but how would you do cross table copy?",2/29/16,1
jasonbeverage,"If I have lots of files in different projections, can I just feed them to the ETL ingest and expect it to reproject or do I need to pre-process them into a tiled mosaic using GDAL beforehand.",2/29/16,1
jasonbeverage,I downloaded a bunch of landsat 8 scenes to play with and I'm expecting that I'll need to do some processing on it before I can ingest it as a mosaic.,2/29/16,1
lossyrob,@pomadchin the table is set on the writer,2/29/16,1
lossyrob,@jasonbeverage good question.,2/29/16,1
lossyrob,"before I redid reproject to be more accurate, the answer would be yes",2/29/16,1
lossyrob,"now with the other reprojection, it depends on the incoming tiles to be the same",2/29/16,1
lossyrob,is it one image per tile?,2/29/16,1
lossyrob,i.e. have you cut up the landsat at all?,2/29/16,1
jasonbeverage,Right now I just have the raw landsat scenes with 11 bands,2/29/16,1
lossyrob,"sorry, have you cut up each image",2/29/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Nope, just raw right now.",2/29/16,1
lossyrob,ok,2/29/16,1
jasonbeverage,I'm extracting them all now from the bz files and coming up with a game plan :),2/29/16,1
lossyrob,"so if you_„Žre trying to reproject landsat bands, and you have the RAM to do it per large image file, then you can use the other type of reproject",2/29/16,1
lossyrob,you could do something like goal_retile.py,2/29/16,1
lossyrob,gdal_retile.py,2/29/16,1
lossyrob,even do a reproject and retile preprocessing step,2/29/16,1
pomadchin,"@lossyrob you are dealing with it right now, guess you know what's going there, but I remember that I had some problems, but can't point you right now ftw was",2/29/16,1
lossyrob,"so, reprojecting a 11 band landsat image (if you want to read it in/coalesce it into a 11 band tile) is a lot of memory to hold",2/29/16,1
lossyrob,"and if you try to do that in an RDD, you can do 1 partition per multiband image, but even that might not be enough",2/29/16,1
lossyrob,"but if it is, then you can just use the alternate reproject",2/29/16,1
lossyrob,"i.e. not use ETL, but write your own ingest",2/29/16,1
lossyrob,that does the reprojection up front,2/29/16,1
lossyrob,"actually you would be able to use ETL with that, by just modifying the source tiles_„_we just changed the ETL so you have a chance to modify the incoming tiles before it goes through the tiling process",2/29/16,1
lossyrob,"sorry I_„Žm sort of thinking out loud here, but I will have to do something very similar soon",2/29/16,1
jasonbeverage,"What is the ""alternate reproject""?",2/29/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Yeah no worries, I have to think out loud all the time to get anything done :)",2/29/16,1
lossyrob,"so there_„Žs two types of reprojection, one which just straight up takes the tiles and reprojects them",2/29/16,1
lossyrob,https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/reproject/ProjectedExtentComponentReprojectMethods.scala,2/29/16,1
lossyrob,"that you can do on keys with a `ProjectedExtentComponent`, i.e. the keys that are coming in from the source tiles (not yet a SpatialKey or SpaceTimeKey)",2/29/16,1
lossyrob,this causes problems when you have tiles that are adjacent in the source CRS,2/29/16,1
lossyrob,"when they reproject to the dest CRS, and you don_„Žt take into account border pixels, you can end up with NoData artifacts",2/29/16,1
lossyrob,so we have this reprojection,2/29/16,1
lossyrob,https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/reproject/TileRDDReproject.scala,2/29/16,1
lossyrob,which works on an indexed tile set (of SpatialKey or SpaceTimeKey),2/29/16,1
lossyrob,"and that way, you can take your source tiles, create a indexed tile set with a floating grid layout in the source CRS, then do that more accurate reprojection to the dest CRS without any nodata artifacts",2/29/16,1
lossyrob,I need to write a blog post about this...,2/29/16,1
lossyrob,"but the thing is, that relies on all the CRSs being the same",2/29/16,1
lossyrob,so currently we have the reprojection in ETL defaulting to all the projection of the incoming set being the same,2/29/16,1
lossyrob,but I think we need to have that be an optional thing,2/29/16,1
jasonbeverage,Yeah I think that would make sense.,2/29/16,1
jasonbeverage,I would think think a common use case would be just taking a bucket of files and of arbitrary resolutions and crs's and ingesting them into a mosaic.,2/29/16,1
jasonbeverage,For now I don't mind to do some pre-processing with GDAL though.,2/29/16,1
lossyrob,"I would say, try to do it by reprojecting the source tiles, and if there_„Žs memory issues there, you might have to do some preprocessing with retile",2/29/16,1
lossyrob,are you trying to ingest them into a single multiband tile?,2/29/16,1
lossyrob,or have different layers for different bands?,2/29/16,1
jasonbeverage,"I may try both.  I think having separate layer for each band could make sense so you can only pull in the bands you need to do like an ndvi, you don't need all 11 bands.",2/29/16,1
lossyrob,"Yeah, I would def suggest that if you_„Žre going to store all 11 bands, since you would be pulling a lot of data you wouldn_„Žt need otherwise, and that would cause IO pain unnecessarily ",2/29/16,1
lossyrob,"But it means you have to run an ingest per band. And also means that the one-image-per-tile thing could work. So in ETL, you could repartition to the RDD count and then do a reproject using the ProjectedComponentReproject method (`sourceTiles.reproject(destCRS, Bilinear)`)",2/29/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Ok, I'm going to need to look through those methods and see if I understand what is going on.",2/29/16,1
lossyrob,Ok cool. If you have some code that I can take a look at I can talk about where this code would go as well,2/29/16,1
jasonbeverage,Basically right now I'm just using ETL as is.,2/29/16,1
jasonbeverage,And that's been nice.,2/29/16,1
lossyrob,"The API recently changed a bit, are you using the old 2 step version?",2/29/16,1
jasonbeverage,But I've also been preprocessing everything up front using gdal to get them into tiles.,2/29/16,1
lossyrob,so in the README,2/29/16,1
lossyrob,https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/tree/master/spark-etl,2/29/16,1
lossyrob,there_„Žs an example of an ETL with the newer style,2/29/16,1
lossyrob,at the point you get the tiles,2/29/16,1
jasonbeverage,I haven't updated to the master since last Thursday I think.  I'm 4 days behind.,2/29/16,1
lossyrob,"instead of doing `val tiles = etl.load[ProjectedExtent, Tile]`",2/29/16,1
lossyrob,sorry not that,2/29/16,1
lossyrob,sorry let me think about this for a second,2/29/16,1
lossyrob,"nevermind, the readme is wrong",2/29/16,1
jasonbeverage,dontreadme,2/29/16,1
jasonbeverage,:),2/29/16,1
lossyrob,lol,2/29/16,1
lossyrob,@pomadchin can you take a look at the README and update it to the current workflow,2/29/16,1
jasonbeverage,I've been using the SingleBandIngest and MultibandIngest since it was added.,2/29/16,1
jasonbeverage,Are you suggesting basically taking what is in Etl.ingest and just customizing it?,2/29/16,1
lossyrob,https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/ingest/Ingest.scala,2/29/16,1
echeipesh,Ok _„_ so hopefully the ETL changes will settle down after the next PR. What would happen right now is that there is a seperation between reading the source tiles and doing anything with them. Check out the actually compiling example: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/spark-etl/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/etl/Etl.scala#L33-L38,2/29/16,1
jasonbeverage,@lossyrob  is that just an alternate ingest from ETL?,2/29/16,1
echeipesh,so between line 34 and 35 you could map over the tiles and reproject each one to the new CRS. At that point you have the tile and the projected extent.,2/29/16,1
echeipesh,Then at that point line 37 will be optional. Line 36 will just cut up those tiles and merge them together. This is the _„ñalternative_„ reproject that lossyrob was talking about.,2/29/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Ok, so line 36 will actually perform the mosaicing for me then?",2/29/16,1
jasonbeverage,So you have multiple tiles that overlap it will merge them into one?,2/29/16,1
lossyrob,that should read `tileToLayout`,2/29/16,1
echeipesh,"yes,  `val tiled = sourceTiles.tileToLayout[K](metadata, NearestNeighbor)`",2/29/16,1
lossyrob,tileToLayout will merge the tiles,2/29/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Ok cool, I actually didn't realize that it would mosaic for you.",2/29/16,1
jasonbeverage,I thought the tiles had to be non-overlapping.,2/29/16,1
lossyrob,no it will preform the merge,2/29/16,1
lossyrob,"the thing is, even with non-overlapping tiles",2/29/16,1
owcm,"I am trying to to use writeArray in HdfsUtils to write out an Array[Byte], ""get compile error find implicit value for evidence parameter of type geotrellis.spark.io.hadoop.formats.HadoopWritable[Byte][error]     HdfsUtils.writeArray( fsPath, conf, geotiff.toByteArray) ""   Is there an import I am missing?",2/29/16,1
lossyrob,"it will create a tile of the same key for multiple images. Say, a tile that represents the image that covers the left half, and a tile that represents the image that covers the right half",2/29/16,1
jasonbeverage,"So as it stood now if I took all my landsat files, warped them all to epsg:3857 and ran gdalretile on them to dump them out to a directory, I should be able to point ETL to all of the files and it should be able to mosaic them together?",2/29/16,1
lossyrob,"so those would have to merge, and the merge simply replaces pixels that are NoData",2/29/16,1
lossyrob,"for merging when there are both pixels in the same location (which won_„Žt happen if you_„Žre doing landsat with SpaceTimeKey but will if they are overlapping and using SpatialKey), then it will choose one at random",2/29/16,1
jasonbeverage,Ok good deal.,2/29/16,1
jasonbeverage,Do you have a recommended size for what to output using gdalretile?  I know in some of your examples you're using 512x512 pixels.,2/29/16,1
lossyrob,"I would go a big bigger, 512x2 or 512 x 4",2/29/16,1
jasonbeverage,That seems pretty small.,2/29/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Yeah ok, that's what I figured.",2/29/16,1
lossyrob,small is good unless youre using S3,2/29/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Yeah right, then you get tons of network reads.",2/29/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Ok, good deal, lots to go on here.  Enough to keep me quiet for a day or two :)",2/29/16,1
lossyrob,"@owcm that utility function was written to work with writing out things like tiles, but not writing generally to HDFS.",2/29/16,1
owcm,"Okay, thanks",2/29/16,1
lossyrob,"you would have to use the hadoop API to write out the bytes (convert it to a BytesWritable, then write it)",2/29/16,1
lossyrob,you can use the contents of that function to figure out the logic for it though,2/29/16,1
pomadchin,@lossyrob what you pointed? sry missed smth in the dialog,2/29/16,1
lossyrob,the README in the spark-etl is broken,2/29/16,1
lossyrob,nevermind tho @echeipesh is taking a look at it,2/29/16,1
pomadchin,"oops, yes, as we introduced reporojection with buffered tiles :\",2/29/16,1
pomadchin,"@lossyrob also looked through that `headerUpdate` function; absolutely useless, you are right and even in the current api we have to remove it; probably can make it during the different fixes pr ",2/29/16,1
pomadchin,"it is a deprecated function which i needed in a wrong api design (in dirty versions of layer management stuff, and in clean version, which is in a master branch, it is useless)",2/29/16,1
lossyrob,"cool, wanted to make sure, I_„Žve removed it in my io refactor codebase",2/29/16,1
pomadchin,"cool, thank a lot, Rob!",2/29/16,1
lokifacio,"hihas it changed the way `RasterMetaData.fromRDD(tiff, f, FloatingLayout(250))` returned the raster extent?I did some test few weeks ago (don't remember which version I was using) and I would say it will return an expanded extent to fit the given layout. Today I am doing another test (with 0.10.0-df9500b) and I get the original tiff extent which is not a multiple of tile size.I 'm just reading a tiff using `val tiff = sc.hadoopGeoTiffRDD(path)`.",3/1/16,1
lokifacio,should I correct the extent myself?,3/1/16,1
lossyrob,The extent from the RasterMetaData now (for a while I think) holds the extent of the original raster,3/1/16,1

viswaug,wow _„_ i was just on freenode IRC and never realized a gitter channel existed :),3/1/16,1
lossyrob,Sorry about that @viswaug! I have been meaning to get to the subject of the room to point to the gitter.,3/1/16,1
viswaug,noob questions here _„_ i am not a scala/java guy (am willing to pick up scala / i have tinkered with clojure in the past)_„_ is using geotrellis still a good idea for a raster statistics service i need to setup in a couple of months?,3/1/16,1
viswaug,@lossyrob np. just feel stupid that is all _„_ computers make me feel that way every day _„_ so NBD,3/1/16,1
lossyrob,"well, *I* think it_„Žs a good idea :)",3/1/16,1
viswaug,"before I found geotrellis, i was thinking about using GDAL on AWS lambda to accomplish my tasks",3/1/16,1
viswaug,?,3/1/16,1
viswaug,does geotrellis always need me to have a cluster idling on AWS,3/1/16,1
lossyrob,not necessarily,3/1/16,1
lossyrob,"GeoTrellis is a Scala library for geospatial types in general, with a lot of raster operations in particular",3/1/16,1
lossyrob,it also has a package (it_„Žs own jar) for doing raster processing with spark,3/1/16,1
viswaug,i mean it needs a cluster of machines to be available to run the tasks all the time right?,3/1/16,1
lossyrob,"you can do that on a single server to take advantage of multiple cores, or run batch jobs on EMR, or run a cluster for doing processing",3/1/16,1
lossyrob,"It doens_„Žt need a cluster of machines, unless you have a spark application that reads from accumulo that needs a cluster of machines. You can use it in many different ways",3/1/16,1
viswaug,"i was thinking in AWS lambda, i could split up the work into chuncks and make HTTP requests to other AWS lambda enpoints to do the work",3/1/16,1
lossyrob,"I don_„Žt know anything about the use case, so that seems like it might work :)",3/1/16,1
viswaug,"this way, i pay for only the compute i need when i need it",3/1/16,1
viswaug,"also, does geotrellis need the rasters to be preprocessed to ARGs ?",3/1/16,1
lossyrob,"well, there_„Žs a new version of GeoTrellis coming out, that has a GeoTiff reader and writer, so no",3/1/16,1
viswaug,my use case is the exact same as the chattanooga TN example on the geotrellis homepage,3/1/16,1
lossyrob,"but if you want to store distributed large rasters, we have support for storing indexed tiled sets in S3, Accumulo, HDFS, or a local file system",3/1/16,1
lossyrob,in which case it_„Žs stored in a binary format that is our own specification (just avro serialized data types),3/1/16,1
viswaug,very neat _„_ i will look for the docs on preprocessing my geotiffs ,3/1/16,1
lossyrob,"like I said, we_„Žre in a bit of a weird state since we are pre-release",3/1/16,1

viswaug,great,3/1/16,1
viswaug,thank you,3/1/16,1
lossyrob,right now the best docs to read are being pulled together as part of this pull request ,3/1/16,1
lossyrob,https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/pull/1330,3/1/16,1
lossyrob,"the documentation for 0.9 on the website is going to give you the rough idea of things, but also the versions are very different from eachother",3/1/16,1
viswaug,thank you for the links _„_ appreciate it,3/1/16,1
lossyrob,"no problem, let me know how it works out!",3/1/16,1
viswaug,sure thing,3/1/16,1
jasonbeverage,@lossyrob fyi I tried with the master geotrellis and still get the same failure.,3/1/16,1
lossyrob,that_„Žs a nasty bug then,3/1/16,1
jasonbeverage,Do you have any idea what it could be though?  Am I running out of memory somewhere?,3/1/16,1
lossyrob,no it_„Žs not a memory thing,3/1/16,1
lossyrob,where it_„Žs throwing is in the stitcher,3/1/16,1

jasonbeverage,"So like I said, basically the input is a folder full of different layers that have all been warped to mercator and then gdalretiled.",3/1/16,1
jasonbeverage,So they will be overlapping.,3/1/16,1
lossyrob,"they will be overlapping, but at the point it_„Žs throwing they shouldn_„Žt be, since it_„Žs already gone through a `tileToLayout` call",3/1/16,1
jasonbeverage,And is it fine that the input files are overlapping and not necessarily in the same tiling scheme?,3/1/16,1
jasonbeverage,Like I took each individual mercator landsat tile and ran gdalretile on it.,3/1/16,1
lossyrob,yeah,3/1/16,1
lossyrob,that is the right way to go about it,3/1/16,1
lossyrob,I think there is just a bug in buffered tiles,3/1/16,1
lossyrob,I_„Žm going to poke around at it,3/1/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Awesome, thanks.  I'll look around as much as I can and see if I can find any more info that might help out.",3/1/16,1
jasonbeverage,Rob I'm going to say you're right.  I just tried a much simpler ingest of a single layer that was gdalretiled that would have worked before and it's failing in the exact same way.,3/1/16,1
lossyrob,"yeah, I just talked it out with @jamesmcclain and I_„Žm pretty sure I_„Žm not handling some corner cases there",3/1/16,1
lossyrob,so he_„Žs currently trying to fix my dumb code :),3/1/16,1
jasonbeverage,I can stick the data that's failing somewhere you can get to it if it would help.,3/1/16,1
lossyrob,"If it_„Žs not a lot of data, then that might help. @jamesmcclain your call",3/1/16,1
jasonbeverage,It's ~4gb,3/1/16,1
lossyrob,ah. in that case I think it might be better to make sure we can_„Žt flush it out with a unit test first,3/1/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Ok, just let me know.  Happy to upload it if it helps.",3/1/16,1

lossyrob,"yeah, these should be pretty soft dependency upgrades. If there_„Žs potential to add last minute bugs, let_„Žs prefer not to upgrade",3/4/16,1
lossyrob,really the slick stuff should be tested as part of integration tests,3/4/16,1
dwins,@lossyrob ok looks like we have a few places in proj4j where we are counting on reference equality rather than structural equality to choose some branches. so serializing and deserializing changes how some code paths work out,3/4/16,1
dwins,pretty mechanical fix i suppose,3/4/16,1
lossyrob,"huh, I hope that works out, that would be a pretty easy fix",3/4/16,1
dwins,well there's a lot of stuff like `if src.setting != tgt.setting { doSomeMath }` to avoid calculations entirely when something should be an identity. aside from speeding things up you avoid accumulating rounding errors in these cases so I think it is a good candidate for the slight discrepancies we're seeing,3/4/16,1
lossyrob,that does make sense. It_„Žs off by so little that it must be a rounding error,3/4/16,1
dwins,i'll review the rest of the code but https://github.com/dwins/geotrellis/commit/4cc9443c2d7255c8cbf84f94e65ca08ff0a631ae makes TileRDDReprojectSpec pass again,3/4/16,1

jasonbeverage,Memory usage is 43.88 GB of 45GB though.,3/8/16,1
echeipesh,That sounds good at least :),3/8/16,1
jasonbeverage,So it at least thinks it's using all the memory,3/8/16,1
jasonbeverage,"```spark.executor.instances         2spark.executor.cores             16```",3/8/16,1
echeipesh,`--num-executors 6 --executor-cores 4` is the args I use for spark-submit,3/8/16,1
jasonbeverage,That makes sense b/c I have 2 follower nodes and they have 16 cores each.,3/8/16,1
lossyrob,https://github.com/hotosm/oam-server-api/blob/master/lib/tiler.js#L116,3/8/16,1
lossyrob,https://github.com/hotosm/oam-server-api/blob/master/lib/tiler.js#L50,3/8/16,1
lossyrob,executors would be the number of nodes * (cores per node / cores per executor),3/8/16,1
lossyrob,then it_„Žs a matter of playing with the executor memory so that you can fit all the executors on one machine,3/8/16,1
lossyrob,which is somewhat less that (memory per node * number of nodes) / number of executors,3/8/16,1
lossyrob,"if executors aren_„Žt being allocated, it_„Žs probably because YARN is seeing that it can_„Žt fit executors on a node because of memory requirements",3/8/16,1
lossyrob,@pomadchin have you been using `mergeUpdate`?,3/8/16,1
jasonbeverage,Cool thanks rob.,3/8/16,1
pomadchin,"@lossyrob yes, but usually I make same thing manually",3/8/16,1
lossyrob,"Also just merged https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/pull/1371, @pomadchin you were asking for that yesterday",3/8/16,1
jasonbeverage,"I was hoping that EMR's ""maximizeResourceAllocation"" setting was just going to work with no tinkering :)",3/8/16,1
pomadchin,@lossyrob cool; btw you looked through implicits reorgonization? o:,3/8/16,1
jasonbeverage,Cool on the merge rob.  Thanks.,3/8/16,1
lossyrob,"@jasonbeverage yeah I had some unexpected results with that, so went to manual mode and tinkered with numbers until the spark UI showed me the right thing",3/8/16,1
lossyrob,@jasonbeverage thank you!,3/8/16,1
lossyrob,@pomadchin I_„Žm thinking about how this merge update should work,3/8/16,1
lossyrob,"There_„Žs a merge that merges two RDD[(K, V)]",3/8/16,1
lossyrob,but no mention of the M,3/8/16,1
lossyrob,"we need to merge the M_„Žs as well, especially now that we support key indexes with larger key bounds then the initially written data",3/8/16,1
lossyrob,"so if I update a layer outside of the original extent and key bounds, I need to update the metadata accordingly",3/8/16,1
lossyrob,we weren_„Žt updating the metadata on our updates,3/8/16,1
pomadchin,"yes, we were planing to refactor updater later",3/8/16,1
lossyrob,cool. later is now now :),3/8/16,1
pomadchin,:D :D ,3/8/16,1
lossyrob,@pomadchin  did you write this? https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/merge/TileRDDMerge.scala,3/8/16,1
pomadchin,do you want to include it into your api refactor pr?,3/8/16,1
pomadchin,@lossyrob Eugene,3/8/16,1
lossyrob,"yeah I am currently messing with the Updaters,  I thought I had them sorted out in that PR but def didnt",3/8/16,1
lossyrob,"@echeipesh I_„Žm thinking that the TileRDDMerge should be on `RDD[(K, V)] with Metadata[M]` instead of just `RDD[(K, V)]`",3/8/16,1
pomadchin,@lossyrob that means that Metadata should provide merge method also,3/8/16,1
lossyrob,yeah,3/8/16,1
pomadchin,actually RasterMetadata type has such function,3/8/16,1
lossyrob,eh I have to push code around to see how it should go,3/8/16,1
echeipesh,"That makes sense, would also give a chance to merge offset layouts.",3/8/16,1
jasonbeverage,Thanks for the tips on the spark settings rob.  It's almost like the spark.executor.cores is being ignored or misused on yarn.,3/8/16,1
pomadchin,@lossyrob @echeipesh old functions to merge rdd_„Žs without metadata would be removed? ,3/8/16,1
jasonbeverage,I changed it so I only had 1 core per executor but an executor per CPU and then just reduced the memory per executor.  Now it's showing lots more vcores in use.,3/8/16,1
lossyrob,"@jasonbeverage nice, that was pretty much the path I took as well",3/8/16,1
lossyrob,@pomadchin I guess I might just be trying to avoid a conflict between RDD_„Žs with or without metadata,3/8/16,1
lossyrob,I_„Žm starting to think that the merge function should just be optionally passed into the updater,3/8/16,1
lossyrob,"and that could just be (_ merge _), which would pick up the MergeMethods implicit at the call site",3/8/16,1
lossyrob,ugh,3/8/16,1
lossyrob,`_ merge _`,3/8/16,1
owcm,"Just a general question, I know you guys are moving towards a major release, and are doing a lot of refactoring.  After the release do you see things stabilizing in terms of packages, classes, traits, etc.   ",3/8/16,1
lossyrob,"yes, the goal is that the API is set at 0.10.0",3/8/16,1
owcm,"Cool beans, thanks",3/8/16,1
lossyrob,"then the next couple of bugfix releases fix any issues, but don_„Žt change APIs*",3/8/16,1
lossyrob,*(we_„Žll see about that. that_„Žs the hope),3/8/16,1
owcm,Cool,3/8/16,1

pomadchin,probably that what we wanted; looks brilliant,3/8/16,1
lossyrob,cool cool,3/8/16,1
lossyrob,@echeipesh it doesn_„Žt look like the `LayerReader`_„Žs `defaultNumPartitions` is used anywhere,3/8/16,1
pomadchin,it would be a generic function which can work with keys out of old layer bounds?,3/8/16,1
lossyrob,just defined in all the readers,3/8/16,1
lossyrob,@pomadchin here is the usage,3/8/16,1
lossyrob,"```scala    val updatedRdd: RDD[(K, V)] =      existingTiles        .leftOuterJoin(rdd)        .mapValues { case (layerTile, updateTile) =>          updateTile match {            case Some(tile) =>              mergeFunc(layerTile, tile)            case None =>              layerTile          }      }```",3/8/16,1
lossyrob,"so if there_„Žs no overlap, it leaves the exsiting tiles alone, but if there_„Žs an update, do the merge",3/8/16,1

lossyrob,are we just matching the kryo version of a spark dependency?,3/9/16,1
pomadchin,we just _have to_ match spark kryo dependency version (2.21),3/9/16,1
lossyrob,for what spark version,3/9/16,1
lossyrob,and what happens when we use a spark with a different version,3/9/16,1
pomadchin,"they should be always the same; yes, of cource you can build your own spark dist with a different kryo version, but I am not sure that it is a popular solution",3/9/16,1
pomadchin,not sure since what time they are using kryo 2.21 by default; but think it is 1.2.x - 1.6.x ,3/9/16,1
pomadchin,probably even earlier spark versions use kryo 2.21 by default,3/9/16,1

pomadchin,"i can agree with you, that to it, it is _easier_ to use spark-submit; and that_„Žs a good idea to use it for jobs (like spark submit); but that_„Žs not too convinient to run server as a pending job (that_„Žs my opinion).for example you can start server on a separate machine on a separate virtual machine and you can relaunch it without killing it as a spark job, but as a separate process (or even whole virtual machine). yes you have to control all dependecies yourself, that_„Žs defintely cons.",3/10/16,1
lossyrob,running the server as a spark-submit job is not as convinient as what?,3/10/16,1
pomadchin,as runing it as a separate executor,3/10/16,1
lossyrob,how do you mean executor,3/10/16,1
pomadchin,"I mean as a client, as in chatta demo",3/10/16,1
lossyrob,how do you start it as a client,3/10/16,1
lossyrob,through the build tool?,3/10/16,1
lossyrob,"I_„Žm looking through `spark-core`_„Žs `pom.xml`, and not finding kryo as a dependency. Where is it that spark 1.6 uses Kryo 2.21?",3/10/16,1
pomadchin,"through the build tool it is not possible, due to the fact we have no build assembly, and it would be not possible to spread this assembly between spark nodes.but we can build assmebly and just to run:`java -jar <fat assembly jar with all deps> <args like spark master, memory, etc>`",3/10/16,1
lossyrob,so what is the difference between doing that `java` call and calling it through `spark-submit`?,3/10/16,1
pomadchin,"you can put your jar on a seprate machine without spark installed (i mean spark distribution), and connect to spark server",3/10/16,1
pomadchin,your app will rise a separate executor (that would be your driver),3/10/16,1
lossyrob,ok. yeah I think that_„Žs just shortcutting how spark is supposed to work.,3/10/16,1
lossyrob,You_„Žre basically bundling a spark installation into the fat jar,3/10/16,1
lossyrob,are there other people doing that?,3/10/16,1
lossyrob,"I haven_„Žt heard of that, maybe I just haven_„Žt found that that_„Žs a valid use case",3/10/16,1
pomadchin,"thinks that_„Žs  good use case: put your server into docker container and rise it on any machine, just by runing smth like `docker run -d --restart <image>`",3/10/16,1
pomadchin,"and you should not even have installed spark distribution anywhere.the cons is that you_„Žve said: you have to provide _same_ dependecies ",3/10/16,1
lossyrob,yeah. I think the docker image should just have a spark installation,3/10/16,1
lossyrob,because if <image> has a spark installation (the spark version you are targeting) then it_„Žs the same thing to just run `spark-submit`,3/10/16,1
lossyrob,"and if you_„Žre running against a cluster, the `spark-submit` should be of the same version of spark as is installed on the worker nodes, and administered through the spark installation",3/10/16,1
pomadchin,"not only the same spark, but the same spark with same dependencies. that_„Žs asbolutely similar to provideing all deps during your application building",3/10/16,1
lossyrob,but then we are managing dependencies,3/10/16,1
lossyrob,"like I said, it_„Žs like bundling a spark installation into a fat jar",3/10/16,1
lossyrob,which I think opens up a lot of room for bad things to happen,3/10/16,1
pomadchin,what bad things?,3/10/16,1
lossyrob,"so, my question is, did we decide not to upgrade kryo because of one of these spark-installed-into-a-fat-jar situations",3/10/16,1
lossyrob,"because then we have to keep track of what dependencies we are pulling in and make sure they match what a spark installation would install, and maintaining that is a burden. and we can just do the normal thing and have spark keep track of itself",3/10/16,1
lossyrob,"because if we pull in dependencies that don_„Žt actually match what a spark installation would have, then we have a different build then what we want to be working with",3/10/16,1
pomadchin,"as already said, i see your point of view, but why there is an api to provide possibility to start your server as a separate node? in order not to have heavy _same spark distr with same libs which you have to provide yourself (kryo is the only one, but it already bundled)_",3/10/16,1
pomadchin,and to make possible to control your application without touching spark api (i mean spark cli),3/10/16,1
lossyrob,because I think it works pretty well in a development environment,3/10/16,1
lossyrob,like through a build tool,3/10/16,1
lossyrob,like our unit tests,3/10/16,1
pomadchin,wow wow,3/10/16,1
lossyrob,"but if your actually running it on a cluster, I don_„Žt think it_„Žs meant for that",3/10/16,1
pomadchin,you cant run app in a distributed fashion without using assembly,3/10/16,1
lossyrob,right,3/10/16,1
lossyrob,"and I don_„Žt think you should run in a distributed fashion without a spark installation, is what I_„Žm saying",3/10/16,1
lossyrob,"perhaps I_„Žm wrong, but can you point me towards something that shows that as a case, or something that corroborates that?",3/10/16,1
lossyrob,"My worry is that if we have a dependency weirdness thing going on with Kryo, and we were seeing that weirdness in an environment that wasn_„Žt using `spark-submit`, I just want to make sure the weirdness isn_„Žt being cause by using spark in an unorthadox manner",3/10/16,1
pomadchin,"i just see no difference in using this approaches, except that fact that you alway have to install spark (and I guess hadoop libs, in some cases) on your machine",3/10/16,1
lossyrob,https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html,3/10/16,1
lossyrob,https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/cluster-overview.html,3/10/16,1
lossyrob,I just don_„Žt see anywhere in the docs where it mentions that use case.,3/10/16,1
lossyrob,"not saying the docs are the final say (see our docs for that), but I just want to know",3/10/16,1
lossyrob,so maybe talking about the kryo weirdness a bit more would give me a perspective on how bundling spark into the client jar is not affecting that,3/10/16,1
pomadchin,"ok, so",3/10/16,1
pomadchin,https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-11416,3/10/16,1
pomadchin,1 they are not going to cahnge kyro version untill major release ,3/10/16,1
pomadchin,"2 yes, if want not to let runing app not using spark-submit, we can update kryo version until whatever we want",3/10/16,1
lossyrob,where does spark set the Kryo version? I don_„Žt see it as a dependency on spark-core,3/10/16,1
lossyrob,which seems weird because that_„Žs where KryoSerializer is,3/10/16,1
lossyrob,or do I just not know how to read poms,3/10/16,1
pomadchin,@lossyrob it depends on twitter chill,3/10/16,1
pomadchin,https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v1.5.2/pom.xml#L147,3/10/16,1
pomadchin,https://github.com/twitter/chill/blob/0.5.0/project/Build.scala#L13,3/10/16,1
lossyrob,gotcha,3/10/16,1
lossyrob,"ok. so we_„Žre depending on javakaffee not doing anything weird, wanting a version 3 and getting a version 2",3/10/16,1
lossyrob,I_„Žm going to bump it down to the last version 2 kryo,3/10/16,1
lossyrob,hopefully that will have the date time stuff we need,3/10/16,1
lossyrob,and it_„Žs only minor versions away,3/10/16,1
lossyrob,"as far as the spark-submit stuff, I hear that the docker deployment gets more difficult if your using spark-submit, but I_„Žm very much in favor of using it if we_„Žre going to think about deploying stuff in a distributed environment. It allows the running to be more configurable, and is the documented way of how to run things in a distributed mode. I_„Žm willing to be swayed if you provide me evidence that it_„Žs something people do, but I_„Žm not swayed by that fact that it _should be_ equivalent.",3/10/16,1
pomadchin,"it _is_ equivalent, and you _can provide same possibility to tune your app, because it has absolutely same configurable spark args_ ",3/10/16,1
lossyrob,this: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/bin/spark-class,3/10/16,1
lossyrob,is the same thing as adding those couple of lines of config in your scala code?,3/10/16,1
pomadchin,"you can also provide args to setup executors cores amount, memory, etc",3/10/16,1
lossyrob,(which calls out to more things that aren_„Žt just a straight java call into your main funciton),3/10/16,1
pomadchin,what do you mean not just a straight call?,3/10/16,1
lossyrob,https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/launcher/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/launcher/Main.java,3/10/16,1
lossyrob,there_„Žs a lot of code/config/setup executed between calling `spark-submit` and executing the chatta demo `Main.main` function,3/10/16,1
lossyrob,"when you run `java -cp _„_`, you_„Žre just entering that Main funciton",3/10/16,1
pomadchin,"```scalanew SparkConf()      .setMaster(argHolder.master)      .setAppName(_„ñServer"")      .set(""spark.serializer"", ""org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer"")      .set(""spark.kryo.registrator"", ""geotrellis.spark.io.hadoop.KryoRegistrator"")      .set(""spark.scheduler.mode"", argHolder.schedulerMode)      .set(""spark.driver.cores"", argHolder.driverCores)      .set(""spark.executor.cores"", argHolder.executorCores)      .set(""spark.cores.max"", argHolder.coresMax)      .set(""spark.executor.memory"", argHolder.executorMemory)      .set(""spark.driver.memory"", argHolder.driverMemory)      .setJars(SparkContext.jarOfObject(this).toList)```",3/10/16,1
lossyrob,so _„ñequivalent_„ doesn_„Žt seem like the correct word here,3/10/16,1
lossyrob,I get that you can set configuration in code. I do.,3/10/16,1
lossyrob,"There is a lot more happening in that code path, if you start by looking at what the `spark-submit` script does, and follow that down to where your Main function would be executed. And you can say that none of that really does anything, but I would have to read through each line of code to be convinced",3/10/16,1
pomadchin,"I am not sure, I can_„Žt say you exactly what _really_ differs. but yes, on machine with an app launched this way, would be arised driver node, and that would be availbe on the default port (4040/4041/_„_/404n).this approach makes sense, and this letting you to conigure you app to suite cluster, and providing possibility not to put some _special_ deps inside spark nodes classpath (they would be included into fat jar and distributed between nodes)",3/10/16,1
pomadchin,"but, probably you are right, and nobody uses this spark api (except me / mine experience). ",3/10/16,1
lossyrob,"yeah, I believe you that it works. I just worry about the spark-submit stuff that I don_„Žt know about what it_„Žs doing. Maybe a good mailing list question?",3/10/16,1
lossyrob,spark mailing list,3/10/16,1
pomadchin,probably yes O:,3/10/16,1
lossyrob,when did you say the DateTime stuff appeared in `kryo-serializers`? Is `0.28` late enough?,3/10/16,1
lossyrob,"if you don_„Žt know offhand don_„Žt worry about it, I thought that you had said it before, I can just compile and see if it works :)",3/10/16,1
pomadchin,since 0.27  kaffe,3/10/16,1
lossyrob,thx,3/10/16,1
pomadchin,"ye, any newer version (mean 3.x) would also be compiling (James tried already); probably this wont even break lunching apps using `spark-submit`",3/10/16,1
pomadchin,"@lossyrob googled that question a bit: nobody uses spark-submit in production (yarn and mesos are our friends); probably it is a good idea to launch spark server as a yarn / mesos job (thought it is also possible to run it using internal api), and we dont need this api,mb this api is for experienced (or just a deprecated thing) users, so probably they can solve these problems manually, by manual deps excluding",3/10/16,1
lossyrob,"sorry, ""nobody uses spark-submit in production_„ did you mean nobody _doesn_„Žt_ use spark-submit?",3/10/16,1
lossyrob,"people launch to YARN or mesos through spark-submit, was my understanding",3/10/16,1
lossyrob,by setting the _„îmaster to a yarn or mesos master,3/10/16,1
lossyrob,"that_„Žs how EMR does it (well, they have a modified version of spark-submit, but still the same sort of workflow)",3/10/16,1
lossyrob,and they submit to YARN,3/10/16,1
pomadchin,ah yes; so _seems_ like api equals ,3/10/16,1
pomadchin,yes you right,3/10/16,1
pomadchin,"i meant standalone, and searched can we start spark context with yarn / mesos usage without calling cli spark-submit.",3/10/16,1
lossyrob,oh gotcha,3/10/16,1
pomadchin,can; but as you sad probably it is not popular or whatever,3/10/16,1

jasonbeverage,"I've got some deployment questions for you all.  I've been using the geotrellis-ec2-cluster project for awhile for doing vagrant and ec2 based deployments, and I'm beginning to wonder if some of the issues I've been running into to are version mismatches.  I've been using your branch @lossyrob with Spark using version 1.5.0+cdh5.5.*.",3/11/16,1
jasonbeverage,Geotrellis looks like it's being built against spark version 1.5.2 but I didn't think it was available on Cloudera yet.,3/11/16,1
jasonbeverage,"geotrellis-ec2-cluster is also using Accumulo 1.6 I think, and geotrellis is built against 1.7.0",3/11/16,1
jasonbeverage,So I suppose what I'm asking is if geotrellis-ec2-cluster is what I should be using for deployment on AWS or is there something else I need to be looking at?,3/11/16,1
echeipesh,"Yes, the published artifacts are built against vanilla spark. Although barring version mismatch between CDH and vanilla you can usually relly on spark not to break API in patch versions. Also @pomadchin found that 1.7.0 client is compatiable with 1.6.0 accumulo cluster.",3/11/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Ok, so in theory it should be good to go then.",3/11/16,1
pomadchin,@jasonbeverage tested with chatta demo compitability (when it was up to master and it was possible to build it),3/11/16,1
echeipesh,Barring version mismatch you should be GTG :)  But lately we_„Žve been leaning on EMR for our internal deployments of GeoTrellis. We will have to figure out how to get Accumulo on that soon too.,3/11/16,1
jasonbeverage,"The reason I even thought it was an issue is that I'm building an assembly locally, uploading it to my instances and then trying to run my tests.",3/11/16,1
jasonbeverage,"The spark jobs like ETL ingest all start and run, although jobs will fail very often with ""Lost executor"" issues.",3/11/16,1
jasonbeverage,And when I try to run some of spray tests I get an exception like this:,3/11/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Exception in thread ""main"" akka.ConfigurationException: Akka JAR version [2.3.9] does not match the provided config version [2.3.4]",3/11/16,1
pomadchin,have you a more complete stack trace? ,3/11/16,1
pomadchin,"because I remember similar issues (but long ago)issues were caused in my case by a bad `.ivy2` cache",3/11/16,1
jasonbeverage,"```Exception in thread ""main"" akka.ConfigurationException: Akka JAR version [2.3.9] does not match the provided config version [2.3.4]at akka.actor.ActorSystem$Settings.<init>(ActorSystem.scala:210)at akka.actor.ActorSystemImpl.<init>(ActorSystem.scala:505)at akka.actor.ActorSystem$.apply(ActorSystem.scala:142)at akka.actor.ActorSystem$.apply(ActorSystem.scala:109)at test.ServeNDVIAccumulo$.main(ServeNDVIAccumulo.scala:28)at test.ServeNDVIAccumulo.main(ServeNDVIAccumulo.scala)```",3/11/16,1
jasonbeverage,So maybe try deleting my ivy2 cache and rebuilding the assembly?,3/11/16,1
pomadchin,probably it may help; and your project is based on @lossyrob ndvi demo project?,3/11/16,1
jasonbeverage,@echeipesh One of my coworkers was able to get Accumulo running on EMR using some scripts from GeoWave,3/11/16,1
echeipesh,"And all the executors fail, you never even get a partial complete of the tasks ?",3/11/16,1
echeipesh,"Awesome, that was my plan to look at those as well.",3/11/16,1
jasonbeverage,"He just got it running last night so he could see the status page, so that was at least a partial win :)",3/11/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Yeah, it's based on that project @pomadchin , just slightly modified to use accumulo and my own ingested data.",3/11/16,1
pomadchin,https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis-landsat-tutorial ?,3/11/16,1
jasonbeverage,"@echeipesh What I've been seeing is just general ingest instability that I don't remember seeing before.  I've got a test that does an s3 to s3 ingest test using ETL with a very low splitSize (so in theory it's not taking up tons of ram) and the first job gets to the last task, then hangs for a bit, then finally the executors start to fail with ""Lost Executor"" on MESOS and if I run on EMR I get failures like ""Lost executor .... remote Rpc client disassociated""",3/11/16,1
owcm,"@ pomadchin  Back on March 7th I was asking about generating lower zoom layers for my 1m and 0.5 resolution data, support zoom layers 19,20,21. You mentioned resample tiles on demand and offered to supply an example.  Decided to go it on my own, was trying that approach and to resample the tile I used the approach:```val resampledTile = vsExtTile.resample(extent, (vsExtTile.cols * resolutionFactor.toInt), (vsExtTile.rows * resolutionFactor.toInt), NearestNeighbor )```Where resolutionFactor is basically the multiplier I derived from the tiles current resolution and the desired resolution. Using the original extent of the source Tile. Of course the resulting tile needs to be cut into quads to support the X/Y/Z tilting. Question is if the resampling call I making is the right call to make. ",3/11/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Also FYI, I'm not using the master geotrellis either.  I'm using the git version right after I submitted the fix for the temporal multiband hadoop stuff.",3/11/16,1
jasonbeverage,Right @pomadchin ,3/11/16,1
echeipesh,"@jasonbeverage Sounds like a dependency conflict, if I had to make a blind guess it would be between the version of akka that spray brings in and the version that sparks brings in. Would be a good thing to try using the sbt dependencyGraph plugin and see if you can match up what is getting pulled from where :(",3/11/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Ok, I'll look into that plugin @echeipesh .",3/11/16,1
jasonbeverage,So akka will come in from spark or is it part of scala?,3/11/16,1
echeipesh,Spark relies on akka for communication between driver/executor. Usually the conflict goes the other way around because spark assembly will be loaded first through `spark-submit` and that will get the spark version of akka into the class loadeder.,3/11/16,1
jasonbeverage,"ok, and I assume akka 2.3.9 is what spark 1.5.2 uses b/c that is what geotrellis is built against.  And when I try to run on a 1.5.0 system it sees akka 2.3.4 and is happy that it's not 2.3.9",3/11/16,1
jasonbeverage,If that is truly an issue then if I want to run on a 1.5 system then I should be able to build geotrellis against spark 1.5.0 I suppose.,3/11/16,1
pomadchin,"yes, there can be a potential problem; seems like geotrellis should work correct (and was tested) only with spark 1.5.2 + versions",3/11/16,1
pomadchin,"you can try to build your own version, yes ._.'",3/11/16,1
jasonbeverage,"An offhand question, do you know of any issues with geotrellis and LZW compressed data?",3/11/16,1
echeipesh,"LZW geotiffs, we should have tests against reading those.",3/11/16,1
jasonbeverage,The reason I ask is that I have one dataset that isn't LZW compressed and it ingests from s3 to s3 just fine.  I have other datasets that are lzw compressed and those the ones that are exhibiting the hanging and then eventually failing from s3 to s3.,3/11/16,1
jasonbeverage,I'll do some more testing but I just wanted to see if there was any caveats anyone could think of.,3/11/16,1
echeipesh,"Also, to think out loud: geotrellis is built against spark 1.5.2 but the dependency is _„ñprovided_„, that is it_„Žs transitive. So we exepct the actual classes and their dependencies to already be available in the class path. Usually that is setup for us by `spark-submit` unless the project using geotrellis explicitly depends on `spark-core`.",3/11/16,1
jasonbeverage,"I have spark-core in my build.sbt for my project, but I have it marked as provided.",3/11/16,1
jasonbeverage,"I'm also using spark-mllib too, I wonder if that is pulling something in.",3/11/16,1
jasonbeverage,Should I also include all of the akka deps in my build.sbt but mark them as provided too?,3/11/16,1
echeipesh,I don_„Žt think that would change anything. Really the only tool you have is changing the version of the dependencies to line up their transitive dependencies.,3/11/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Ok great, thanks for the help!",3/11/16,1
jasonbeverage,So on EMR you're using emr-4.2.0 since it has spark 1.5.2 correct?,3/11/16,1
lossyrob,@jasonbeverage yeah we_„Žre using that EMR,3/11/16,1
echeipesh,"yep, 4.2.0",3/11/16,1
lossyrob,"@lokifacio thanks for the input on the renaming, great to have input on those decisions",3/11/16,1
aaron-santos,"Hi, I'm trying to use `Rasterizer.rasterizeWithValue`to generate a basetile, but I'm having a hard time generating the right `RasterExtent`.",3/11/16,1
aaron-santos,"It looks like I can plug my geometry's extent like so `RasterExtent(geometry.envelope, ...`",3/11/16,1
lossyrob,"yeah, depending on what version your using the API can be a little nicer, but to use the Rasterizer, you_„Žd want to take the envelope and then figure out the # of cols and rows",3/11/16,1
aaron-santos,"But I'm at a bit of a loss when it comes to the `cellwidth`, `cellheight`, `cols`, `rows` arguments",3/11/16,1
lossyrob,and then do something like,3/11/16,1
lossyrob,"```scalaval geom: Polygon = ???val re: RasterExtent = RasterExtent(geom.envelope, 256, 256) // 256 cols x 256 rowsRasterizer.rasterizeWithValue(re, value)```",3/11/16,1
lossyrob,or however that rasterizer call goes,3/11/16,1
lossyrob,the object apply will compute the correct cellwidth and cellheight,3/11/16,1
aaron-santos,"oh, nice!",3/11/16,1
lossyrob,"they are there explicitly so in case you care more about the resolution (30 meter by 30 meter), you can have it so it might not be exact where (extent.xmax- extent.xmin)/cellwidht == cols",3/11/16,1
lossyrob,"but generally raster extent is thought of as an extent + a (col, row) grid",3/11/16,1
timothymschier,"to get Accumulo up on EMR, I took the GeoWave bootstrap scripts and commented out the GeoWave parts: https://gist.github.com/timothymschier/0794a196af044055552d",3/11/16,1
timothymschier,"then when configuring the EMR cluster, set the ""bootstrap jar"" value (yeah website calls it jar) point to bootstrap-bda8.sh (which was uploaded to S3)",3/11/16,1

timothymschier,yeah those...,3/11/16,1

lossyrob,can you try bumping up the splitSize to 50,3/12/16,1
timothymschier,"roger that, kicked off again",3/12/16,1
lossyrob,might be a corrupt object_„_best way to figure it out I would think is to wrap the failing code in a try/catch and print out the bucket/key combo to see what file it is,3/12/16,1

timothymschier,"ok, can give that a shot...",3/12/16,1
timothymschier,is it worth trying that on latest master? we have a fork from ~10 days ago,3/12/16,1
lossyrob,could be,3/12/16,1
lossyrob,"but this is a pretty strange error, in the s3 client, so I_„Žm not sure it_„Žs that",3/12/16,1
timothymschier,ok ... even that file I notice has changed since our fork,3/12/16,1
timothymschier,ok how about a quicker test (while I'm doing the code change and re-building) - just trying it with the latest bintray rather than this older fork,3/12/16,1
lossyrob,I just can_„Žt fathom how it_„Žs getting a negative number in that array size in ByteArrayOutputStream,3/12/16,1
lossyrob,"hopefully will work, though if API changed then you_„Žll have to update the code",3/12/16,1
timothymschier,I think we're just calling the native spark-etl for the ingest though,3/12/16,1
timothymschier,so hope no code recompile,3/12/16,1
timothymschier,in fact I was just going to ask a silly qn - is there a shaded jar URL somewhere that I could download and use?,3/12/16,1
lossyrob,all the dependencies have updated too,3/12/16,1
lossyrob,so there_„Žd be about 4 or 5 off of spark-etl that you_„Žd have to update,3/12/16,1
timothymschier,getting the same `NegativeArraySizeException` in the run with the splitSize at 50,3/12/16,1
timothymschier,what if I start with a clean slate and just want to try ingest using a single spark-submit call?,3/12/16,1
lossyrob,this is where it_„Žs throwing,3/12/16,1

lossyrob,that_„Žs a pretty deep error. I don_„Žt see how that should every be the case,3/12/16,1
timothymschier,what fun!,3/12/16,1
lossyrob,my strategy would be to find the file and then try to read it directly with the S3 client to see if you get the error reading the file just through a single call,3/12/16,1
lossyrob,but I have to knock off for the night,3/12/16,1
lossyrob,so I_„Žll check in tomorrow to see you had any luck,3/12/16,1
timothymschier,"no worries, ta for your help :)",3/12/16,1
lossyrob,"np, cheers",3/12/16,1
timothymschier,hey folks I'm having trouble building the master branch,3/13/16,1
timothymschier,I did a fresh clone from https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis,3/13/16,1
timothymschier,"```rm -rf ~/.ivy2/cache```to clean out issues with the cache",3/13/16,1
timothymschier,"```./sbt assembly```",3/13/16,1
timothymschier,"and I get errors:```[error] (geotrellis/*:assembly) deduplicate: different file contents found in the following:[error] /home/hadoop/.ivy2/cache/com.esotericsoftware/kryo/bundles/kryo-3.0.3.jar:com/esotericsoftware/kryo/Kryo$DefaultSerializerEntry.class[error] /home/hadoop/.ivy2/cache/com.esotericsoftware.kryo/kryo/bundles/kryo-2.21.jar:com/esotericsoftware/kryo/Kryo$DefaultSerializerEntry.class```",3/13/16,1
timothymschier,and many more of the same - issues withe kryo version numbers,3/13/16,1
timothymschier,"Also, for those interested just finished running ingest on each of the 896 files independently. No failures. Re-ran the ingest with all the files together, got the same old failure we'd been getting previously (```ExecutorLostFailure```, the one likely to be related to dependency versions; the ```NegativeArraySizeException``` seems to have disappeared?!?). So keen to see if we can do a clean build of a newer GeoTrellis and try the latest Spark ETL.",3/13/16,1
timothymschier,"Next thing I've tried is modifying our own project - updated reference in ```build.sbt``` from dependencies of ```""com.azavea.geotrellis"" %% ""geotrellis-spark""     % ""0.10.0-SNAPSHOT""``` to```""com.azavea.geotrellis"" %% ""geotrellis-spark""     % ""0.10.0-aee77fa""``` (and same for geotrellis-spark-etl).Did a ```./sbt assembly```, copied the JAR, ran the ingest again with:```spark-submit --class geotrellis.spark.etl.SinglebandIngest bda-geotrellis-test-assembly-0.1.1.jar --format geotiff --input s3 -I splitSize=50 bucket=bda8.data key=test_5_2_input --output s3 -O bucket=bda8.data key=kmeans_ingest --layer kmeans --pyramid --layoutScheme tms --crs EPSG:3857 --tileSize 256 --clobber ```and still getting the ExecutorLostFailure happening.",3/13/16,1
timothymschier,"to me it seems like this should be using a latest-built version of GeoTrellis, so shouldn't have the dependency issues?",3/13/16,1
timothymschier,"hmm... wait. I'm getting the stderr output saying there were exceptions, but the EMR Spark Application History is saying that the job ran successfully :S... it does seem to be not doing the old behaviour of failing on the last executor; this time it's on job 0.0. Perhaps it's a Spark shutdown issue? Do others see this sort of thing?",3/13/16,1
lossyrob,"@timothymschier I_„Žve seen something similar before, but it_„Žs usually either a dependency issue (my fear is it_„Žs a AWS S3 sdk version issue with your S3 region, we are using an older SDK version for compatibility reasons), or something wrong with the setup.",3/13/16,1
lossyrob,"have geotrellis builds gotten slower, or am I imagining that? I feel like in the last week compiling has taken longer",3/13/16,1
timothymschier,"Ah interesting, hopefully something that straightforward. We're in US NEast (Virginia) region. I can try copying it over to HDFS before ingest.",3/13/16,1
lossyrob,that might be a good workaround actually,3/13/16,1
lossyrob,"@timothymschier pretty sure you were reading a very large file off of S3. The negative array index would happen when the # of bytes becomes greater than Int.MaxValue, causing the index inside of ByteArrayOutputStream it to overflow and go negative.",3/14/16,1
timothymschier,"@lossyrob  looks like that could be it. Easy trap though, because the large tif isn't actually inside the same folder: bda8.data/test_5_2_input.tif vs bda8.data/test_5_2_input/*.tif",3/14/16,1
timothymschier,I've had success doing an S3->S3 ingest from bda8.public bucket. S3->Accumulo had a failure; just re-running now.,3/14/16,1
lossyrob,"s3 works by key prefixes, it_„Žs not really a folder structure, so a key prefix `test_5_2_input` would include both",3/14/16,1
timothymschier,ah indeed,3/14/16,1
timothymschier,so it would also include ```test_5_2_input_old.tif``` which I just renamed it to *headslap*,3/14/16,1
lossyrob,i believe so. may could check with a `aws s3 ls` client listing before ingest,3/14/16,1
timothymschier,yeah looks like that was the issue - us not understanding S3... at least now we can get on with the rest of our eval now that we have ingested data :),3/14/16,1
lossyrob,this worked out nicely: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/commit/eaf719a0cfa73e6bda78f59958ae5ef04302f363,3/14/16,1
lossyrob,"kudos to @echeipesh, _„Žtis great when good API design pays off down the road.",3/14/16,1
jasonbeverage,@lossyrob Thanks for the help tracking down that s3 ingest error.  It didn't click until @timothymschier started emailing you :),3/14/16,1
jasonbeverage,"We have a bunch of big tiffs we're ingesting, and I wrote a script to warp them and run gdal_retile.py on them, and they dump out directories with the same name as the source tiff, which I then uploaded back to s3.",3/14/16,1

moradology,do we want all implicit extension methods to be listed on the objects they extend in our scaladocs?,3/14/16,1

jamesmcclain,^^ Here are the parameter name changes that I made,3/14/16,1
lossyrob,ok cool I_„Žll make taht change too,3/14/16,1
jamesmcclain,"That patch includes sorting of an import block, as well",3/14/16,1
jamesmcclain,I am writing up the README for the util package.  I have a question: what is the motivation for using extension methods throughout the library rather than making direct additions to the types themselves,3/14/16,1
lossyrob,"It allows for code organization, so that all methods don_„Žt end up in one big type file",3/14/16,1
lossyrob,it allows for methods to be written in an abstract way for multiple types that can utilize it,3/14/16,1
lossyrob,e.g. implicit method additions that work over MultibandTile and Tile,3/14/16,1
lossyrob,it provides a framework for adding functionality that does not require modifying core types,3/14/16,1
lossyrob,"it keeps the core types simple, with those types only defining what necessarily makes up that type",3/14/16,1
lossyrob,"it allows other functionality to require that a type T has methods defined by that extentsion, i.e. the `[T: ? => CropMethods[T]]` thing, so that that funcitonality does not have to be written against core types",3/14/16,1
lossyrob,this allows for later adding types that will still work with those functions,3/14/16,1
lossyrob,"e.g. client code an define their own types that give the proper method extensions, and that funcitonality will still work",3/14/16,1
jamesmcclain,"Okay thanks, I will add those points",3/14/16,1
bneff,"Hey Rob, if I'm using ZoomedLayoutScheme, is there a way I can determine the extent of a tile so I can store that in another service and have it match what is in my catalog?",3/14/16,1
lossyrob,"yeah, there_„Žs two ways you can do it_„_",3/14/16,1
lossyrob,"if you have the layer metadata, you can do it generally by pulling out the metadata.mapTransform and applying it to the SpatialKey",3/14/16,1
lossyrob,"but if you know it_„Žs ZoomedLayoutScheme, it_„Žs a bit more straightforward",3/14/16,1
lossyrob,hold on I think there might be an example floating around,3/14/16,1
lossyrob,@rajadain where did that code live where you were doing this exact thing?,3/14/16,1
lossyrob,oops that_„Žs in a private repo,3/14/16,1

bneff,@lossyrob thank you!,3/14/16,1

lossyrob,oh actually the repo is open my bad,3/14/16,1

lossyrob,"so as long as you know the tileSize, and have the zoom and the SpatialKey, that same logic will give you the Exent your looking for",3/14/16,1
bneff,"I'm slow, but I'm assuming I could also use this to go from Extent to Spatial Key?",3/14/16,1
lossyrob,"Yeah, but not exactly",3/14/16,1
lossyrob,because an extent might intersect with more than one SpatialKey,3/14/16,1
lossyrob,so what you get back is a GridBounds,3/14/16,1
lossyrob,"`GridBounds(colMin, rowMin, colMax, rowMax)`",3/14/16,1
lossyrob,which describes the tile keys that intersect the extent,3/14/16,1
bneff,@lossyrob thats perfect for us! Thanks again!,3/14/16,1
lossyrob,"and that_„Žs on `MapKeyTransform`, so it_„Žs just a matter of `val gridBounds = transform(extent)`",3/14/16,1
lossyrob,no problem!,3/14/16,1
timothymschier,"hey guys, just a quick performance qn - I'm seeing ingest from S3 to S3 as being ~50% faster than ingest from S3 to Accumulo; running on the same cluster. Is that expected? Is it maybe a sign of an underpowered cluster?",3/15/16,1
lossyrob,"This is interesting, I_„Žve seen some performance problems with accumulo ingests, @jamesmcclain is looking into optmizing accumulo ingest over th next couple of weeks, so we might have a better answer for you then. But basically we do a bulk ingest of data, which copies it to HDFS and then creates the accumulo RFiles for the table after that step; though it seems completely counter intuitive that an S3 ingest would be faster.",3/15/16,1
timothymschier,OK thanks @lossyrob I'll keep an eye out for the work from @jamesmcclain . In the meantime I'm doing the performance profiling this week so I'll have to go with the S3 numbers. Seem to be ~9MB/s for RGB temporal ingests on S3-S3 vs ~6MB for S3-Accumulo. This was using the geotrellis-ec2-cluster AMIs too (both Accumulo and S3) on m3.2xlarge cluster with 2 followers.,3/15/16,1
Prasannads,"Hi guys, can you please share me a code snippet on how to store a TIFF file from local path into HDFS as RasterRDD ? i am using the bintray version ""6c567b2""",3/15/16,1
pomadchin,"@Prasannads hi; you mean to ingest into hdfs, and after that to deal with tiff data operating with RasterRDD?",3/15/16,1
Prasannads,"@pomadchin  yes, my use case is to ingest tiffs into HDFS and do some local map algebra operations on top of it .",3/15/16,1
pomadchin,"To ingest, it is possible to use `spark-etl` project: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/docs/spark-etl/spark-etl-intro.md",3/15/16,1

lokifacio,RasterRDD is now TileLayerRDD,3/15/16,1
pomadchin,@lokifacio @Prasannads working on updating https://github.com/pomadchin/geotrellis-chatta-demo probably that would be a useful usage example,3/15/16,1
lokifacio,"@pomadchin cool. I see that TileLayerMetadata now requires an extra bounds parameter, what is it meant for?",3/15/16,1
Prasannads,@lokifacio  ok. Seems RasterMetadata is now TileLayerMetadata .,3/15/16,1
lokifacio,yep,3/15/16,1

Prasannads,@lokifacio  Can you please share the code once you have done updating it ? i think HadoopLayerWriter does not require TileLayerMetadata?,3/15/16,1
lokifacio,"@Prasannads, just a quick glance: it seems now you need to construct a new object instead of using a method of the object companion (similar to Java statics)",3/15/16,1
lokifacio,and then call read/write,3/15/16,1
lokifacio,but now sure on how to deal with generic parameters yet,3/15/16,1

cdelgadob,"Hi all, I'm new to geotrellis, and generally to all GIS world. I'm here because I'm facing a GIS-related problem in a Hadoop-Spark environment. We have a lot of points (coordinates (lat, lon) in Mercator projection, same as Google's, right?) and I need to calculate which points are less than 100m to each other.

In reality it is only ever sent out once per writing a layer, so the extra overhead of including a full class name is nothing and since we effectivly don_„Žt have control over the version of Avro being brought in by spark we may find that any workaround we make is going to be fragile.",3/15/16,1
pomadchin,@echeipesh any workaroung in fact is fragile. moreover any client custom hadoop build depends on its own avro ,3/15/16,1
echeipesh,"yep, exactly what I am thinking.",3/15/16,1
echeipesh,"In fact since we_„Žre writing docs, I really need to make a section on dependency management issues since it comes up so often and is so frustrating.",3/15/16,1
lossyrob,I would say we shouldn_„Žt register it if it_„Žs a type coming in from the client,3/15/16,1
lokifacio,would very appreciated ,3/15/16,1
lossyrob,@pomadchin are you making that change? ,3/15/16,1
pomadchin,@lossyrob not to register avro field? ,3/15/16,1
pomadchin,currently I am debugging ingest process (all backends) to be sure that everything works + fixing definetly not working accumulo,3/15/16,1
lossyrob,ok I can make it,3/15/16,1
pomadchin,@lossyrob you want to remove it form registration? now we have to add these lines manually on the client side? hm,3/15/16,1
lossyrob,you don_„Žt have to add them,3/15/16,1
lossyrob,it just means that the schema will be encoded with a string to identify the class,3/15/16,1
lossyrob,which causes a little bit of bloat,3/15/16,1
lossyrob,for serialization,3/15/16,1
lossyrob,"but if a client wants to solve that, then yeah the would have to register the schema themselves with Kryo",3/15/16,1
lossyrob,"which makes sense, because it_„Žs a client side dependency",3/15/16,1
lossyrob,"if we don_„Žt have control over the Avro they are using, then we shouldn_„Žt register it",3/15/16,1
pomadchin,:+1:,3/15/16,1
lossyrob,"unless we explicitly state, _„ñthis is the avro version you have to use""",3/15/16,1
lossyrob,but then that_„Žs a bit out of their control becasue taht is deteremined by the hadoop version,3/15/16,1

Prasannads,@pomadchin  thanks !,3/17/16,1
Prasannads,"@lossyrob  , @pomadchin  any documentation on how to get a tiff out of this from hdfs?",3/17/16,1
lossyrob,"do you want a single geotiff? you would have to read the layer out, call `.stitch` to convert it into a Raster, and then use that to create a `SinglebandGeoTiff`, and then write it out",3/17/16,1
lossyrob,I can point you to all the relevant code,3/17/16,1
lossyrob,https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/io/hadoop/HadoopLayerReader.scala#L64,3/17/16,1

Prasannads,?,3/17/16,1
lossyrob,yeah you don_„Žt need to save it off into a backend,3/17/16,1
lossyrob,"we do that if we want to not have to tile it again, and so we can run spatial or spatiotemporal queries against teh data",3/17/16,1

pomadchin,sry for that :D) will try a bit debugging,3/18/16,1
pomadchin,also remember about issues with certain tiles ingesting ,3/18/16,1
lokifacio,I've done plenty of tests with ingest/write,3/18/16,1

Prasannads,@lokifacio  were you able to see the tiffs in the windows image viewer?,3/18/16,1

pomadchin,i am cuirious how focal operations effect data,3/18/16,1
Prasannads,@pomadchin  i tried saving the tiles before i do any operation on it . i can see only black image. should i use any tiff viewer like QGis? i use windows photo viewer . i dont think that is a problem. because i am able to see other tiffs downloaded from the internet,3/18/16,1
pomadchin,"yes, try QGis",3/18/16,1

lokifacio,if you want I'll try other ops (add or double) to check if I get the same result as @Prasannads ,3/18/16,1
lokifacio,@pomadchin this is even more intriguing for me... I've read raster resulting from first focal which seems right in QGIS and applying a focal to it gives the same results as chaining the two focals from the source raster...

lokifacio,"I've just checked raster information using QGIS and I found a possible clue: original raster has   `NoDataValue=-1.6999999999999999e+308` whereas focal output has `NoData Value=nan`, could it be the cause of the problem?",3/18/16,1

Focalsum does not need to be a method available to RDD_„Žs.   So I would think I would need to convert back to a TileLayerRDD, before doing the FocalSum.

lossyrob,you have to thread the metadata context through using `withContext`,3/18/16,1

lossyrob,"because the local operations aren_„Žt on TileLayerRDD, just regular RDD of tiles",3/18/16,1

echeipesh,So essentially when it reached a region where there was nothing to feed the neighborhood it was in this invalid state,3/18/16,1
lossyrob,so really we should just be more careful around ND values in our focal ops,3/18/16,1

owcm,"Yea, I am currently looking at the file in qgis, and what you are getting makes sense.    I need to go back and retest.   I know in the Spark environment where I am using the Pyramiding to create the Z/X/Y tiling I was getting pure green.  So it must be something I am doing wrong.",3/23/16,1
owcm,I will test on the individual file again and make sure I am getting the same results as you.,3/23/16,1
jasonbeverage,"I figured out my issue earlier, sorry for the noise.  I missed this little tidbit from the spark documentation""Note that applications should define a main() method instead of extending scala.App. Subclasses of scala.App may not work correctly.""",3/23/16,1
jasonbeverage,that part should be in bold :),3/23/16,1
jasonbeverage,Not subclassing App and just doing a regular main worked like a charm.,3/23/16,1
dwins,"not too surprising, `App` does weird stuff to make `main` call the constructor",3/23/16,1
echeipesh,"I guess its the result of the `DelayedInit` machinery in `App`, still crazy consequence.",3/23/16,1
pomadchin,yes it always causes unexpected bugs ._.,3/23/16,1
lossyrob,"Initialization bugs. They produce weird nulls. Delayed init will do it, I usually see it with trait initialization order.",3/23/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Yeah it was an annoying issue b/c I came into this not knowing Scala, and I saw lots of applications using App (even the ETL Ingest apps) so I figured that was the way to go :)",3/23/16,1
pomadchin,also as a workaround with App extended objects it_„Žs possible just to use call-by-name everywhere :D so lazy vals and functions are your friends,3/23/16,1
jasonbeverage,for now I'm just going to go with mains :)  I still need to level up my scala-fu,3/23/16,1
pomadchin,:+1:,3/23/16,1
lossyrob,"yeah I switched to never using the App stuff ever, it_„Žs less magical and less room for bugz",3/23/16,1
dwins,now i'm wondering if macro annotations could let you have a bare def converted to a runnable object,3/23/16,1
dwins,`@entryPoint def MyApp(args: Array[String]): Unit` expanding to an object with a main method seems convenient,3/23/16,1
pomadchin,"probably we can implement it, and that_„Žs really not hard to implement smth like that",3/23/16,1
pomadchin,but it seems to me that to use it we need to pull macro paradise plugin,3/23/16,1
dwins,guess it can go on the back burner for now,3/23/16,1
moradology,Do we have a style-consensus on companion objects after classes?,3/23/16,1
moradology,or is that not something we care about,3/23/16,1
echeipesh,I_„Žm not sure we have a strict style. I prefer to put it after myself.,3/23/16,1
lossyrob,I like to put it before,3/23/16,1
lossyrob,if it_„Žs smaller then the class or trait def,3/23/16,1
pomadchin,:D,3/23/16,1
pomadchin,think the answer is depends,3/23/16,1
pomadchin,in some cases we put it under the trait in some above ._.,3/23/16,1
moradology,cool. i'll just stay hands off then,3/23/16,1
moradology,"as i write docs, that is",3/23/16,1
moradology,"(my preference is definitely for companions after, fwiw)",3/23/16,1
moradology,"adding documentation, there are some methods that maybe could be removed: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/vector/src/main/scala/geotrellis/vector/affine/PointTransformationMethods.scala",3/23/16,1
moradology,"you can't rescale a point or rotate a point, forinstance",3/23/16,1
moradology,but maybe we want that for parity with methods on other geoms? I'm curious to hear thoughts on that,3/23/16,1
lossyrob,yeah I_„Žm sure it was done because those things are available generally on geometries,3/23/16,1
dwins,would you say that you can't multiply a number by 1 or add 0 to it?,3/23/16,1
moradology,that's a fair point,3/23/16,1
lossyrob,:fire:,3/23/16,1
lossyrob,"the thing is, those methods aren_„Žt written against geometry genericly",3/23/16,1
lossyrob,"so there_„Žs probably a better way to do it where it makes more sense to treat it generically, and call rotate on a point",3/23/16,1
moradology,the 1 and 0 point makes a lot of sense for scale - an infinitely small scale multiplied by whatever remains infinitely small,3/23/16,1
moradology,rotation over a point is less obviously analogous,3/23/16,1
lossyrob,"but the way it_„Žs set up, not sure",3/23/16,1
dwins,I guess a generic implementation would suffer a bit performancewise because of having to test the class to find which wrapper to use,3/23/16,1
lossyrob,0 * x seems to be a rotation analogy,3/23/16,1
moradology,perhaps. the intuitions here are messy,3/23/16,1
dwins,I see that we have https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/vector/src/main/scala/geotrellis/vector/affine/AffineTransformation.scala#L18-L25,3/23/16,1
dwins,"having both the MethodExtensions version of these methods and the ""an affine transform is a function"" version seems unnecessary",3/23/16,1
lossyrob,yeah,3/23/16,1
dwins,where are the implicit conversions to PointTransformationMethods anyway?,3/23/16,1
dwins,oh i see. they're in the geotrellis.vector package object,3/23/16,1
dwins,"```scala> Point(1,2).scale(2,4)res1: geotrellis.vector.Point = POINT (2 8)```",3/23/16,1
dwins,"It's not a no-op anyway because you're not scaling the point, you're scaling the plane that the point is on",3/23/16,1
dwins,@moradology @lossyrob ,3/23/16,1
moradology,aaaah. that's a big difference,3/23/16,1
lossyrob,"oh, weird",3/23/16,1
dwins,makes sense if you think about it because applying a transform works vertex-by-vertex on a line or polygon. if scaling a point was a no-op then scaling anything else would be as well,3/23/16,1
lossyrob,yeah that makes sense,3/23/16,1
lossyrob,"you need to scale from some center point, which is always 0,0",3/23/16,1
dwins,exactly,3/23/16,1
moradology,cool. thanks @dwins ,3/23/16,1
moradology,that also helps to make sense of how shear is supposed to work given only two numbers as arguments,3/23/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Hey all, has the old ""clobber"" option from ETL been replaced with anything else?",3/24/16,1
jasonbeverage,I'm doing an ingest to HDFS over an existing layer and I get a failure b/c of a directory already existing in hdfs,3/24/16,1
jasonbeverage,Like Caused by: java.lang.Exception: Directory already exists: /layers/mylayer/18,3/24/16,1
pomadchin,@jasonbeverage was just removed ): https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/commit/4dc26f43a9a4b394d3f86b4d69e2efba46348ca0,3/24/16,1
pomadchin,guess it would be not bad to have such option though,3/24/16,1
jasonbeverage,"No worries, just making sure I knew what was going on :)",3/24/16,1
jasonbeverage,"I've got a couple of scripts I'm running through that ingest data, do something on the ingested data and then just report timings.  And some of the tests use the same data so the second run through things were dying and I didn't notice that directory exists error deep in the stack trace until now :)",3/24/16,1
lossyrob,"the clobber option was kind of a lie_„_it wasn_„Žt actually doing the thing it was proporting to do, so we took it out",3/24/16,1
jasonbeverage,Makes sense.,3/24/16,1
jasonbeverage,"I've got a conceptual question about deploying and scaling out a spray based server using geotrellis.  I've got a couple of little server programs that do various things based on your landsatdemo @lossyrob.  I'm able to run them using spark-submit, that works fine.  Normally if I were want to scale out a web service, I'd just run multiple instances of the same behind an ELB, but I'm trying to understand the relationship between how spray and spark relate.",3/24/16,1
jasonbeverage,"For example, if you spark-submit a spray server on a 1000 node spark cluster, is there any benefit to trying to scale out the spray server or is spark somehow doing that?",3/24/16,1
lossyrob,well there_„Žs the bottleneck of handling requests,3/24/16,1
lossyrob,and then the bottleneck of running thing through the spark master,3/24/16,1
lossyrob,they_„Žre both two points of contention that should be considered,3/24/16,1
lossyrob,"if you have 1000 spray service endpoints all making job requests to the same spark master, that_„Žs going to cause a lot of contention",3/24/16,1
lossyrob,"you can actually run multiple spark masters against the same cluster; however this is a more advnaced setup that we haven_„Žt actually put into practice yet, so I can_„Žt speak to it too deeply",3/24/16,1
lossyrob,you could also run smaller clusters that load out subsets of data into ephemeral storage from a large distributed store like S3 and parallelize tasking that way,3/24/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Yeah, as just a raw tile server I'm curious as to what the benefits of using spark really are.",3/24/16,1
lossyrob,"also if your spark jobs are running on small subsets, you can just have them load from S3 and run the spark _„ñcluster_„ on a single server",3/24/16,1
lossyrob,"ah, so for serving out tiles",3/24/16,1
jasonbeverage,Like just on serving out tiles.,3/24/16,1
lossyrob,unless you_„Žre doing some grouping operations,3/24/16,1
lossyrob,it doesn_„Žt need spark,3/24/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Yeah sorry, just using the TileReader",3/24/16,1
lossyrob,yeah. no spark required,3/24/16,1
lossyrob,spark does all the heavy lifting in the preprocesses step,3/24/16,1
lossyrob,so that the tile readers can just read what tiles they need and use geotrellis-raster_„Žs core types to do the calculations and paint tiles,3/24/16,1
lossyrob,which is much faster than going throuhg spark-anything,3/24/16,1
jasonbeverage,Why am I thinking I needed spark to even instantiate a tile reader :)  ,3/24/16,1
lossyrob,"we_„Žre talking about making a way to run the LayerQuery_„Žs against somethign that just does parallel fetches of tiles, so even in small grouping cases you can avoid using spark",3/24/16,1
jasonbeverage,Was that for Accumulo maybe?,3/24/16,1
lossyrob,hopefully not ,3/24/16,1
lossyrob,I thougt we got rid of that,3/24/16,1
jasonbeverage,"Ok, that might be true.  I got that from looking at the spark version of the chatta demo I think.  https://github.com/pomadchin/geotrellis-chatta-demo/blob/spark-version/geotrellis/src/main/scala/geotrellis/chatta/ChattaServiceActor.scala",3/24/16,1
lossyrob,"so, that chatta demo calculates breaks",3/24/16,1
lossyrob,"which is an operation that happens on a layer, so an RDD of tiles, so it needs the spark stuff",3/24/16,1
lossyrob,"but for the actual tms service endpoint, no SparkContext should be required",3/24/16,1
jasonbeverage,Ok very good to know.,3/24/16,1
jasonbeverage,So a spray service should just be able to run using java -cp then.,3/24/16,1
jasonbeverage,This is the reason I thought I had to have a spark context to use a tile reader:  https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/io/hadoop/HadoopTileReader.scala#L21,3/24/16,1
jasonbeverage,"The tile readers have implicit spark contexts, so I get build errors unless I define one.",3/24/16,1
lossyrob,dang. that_„Žs my fault,3/24/16,1
lossyrob,is it all the tile readers or just hadoop?,3/24/16,1
jasonbeverage,Maybe just hadoop,3/24/16,1
jasonbeverage,Accumulo doesn't and neither does s3,3/24/16,1
jasonbeverage,"So just hadoop, there ya go.",3/24/16,1
lossyrob,oh actually hadoop does need one,3/24/16,1
lossyrob,because it doesn_„Žt actually have the ability to read a single tile not via spark,3/24/16,1
lossyrob,"which is something we would just have to work out, but no pre-0.10",3/24/16,1
jasonbeverage,Ok awesome.,3/24/16,1
jasonbeverage,That helps me wrap my head around how to scale up tile serving then and makes more sense.,3/24/16,1
jasonbeverage,I could definitely see the benefit of using spark for distributed raster calculations but couldn't get how it would help for just serving tiles :),3/24/16,1
lossyrob,yeah all of the light lifting stuff should just use the core geotrellis stuff,3/24/16,1
owcm,Question: I am loading a set of  elevation rasters into a TileLayerRDD layout and doing my map algebra ops.  I wanted to load a landcover raster into another TileLayerRDD and perform some additional map algebra ops with my first  TileLayerRDD.  The landcover  raster extent overlays the rasters in my first TileLayerRDD.  I am using the same scheme Layout schemes  and Tiling approaches.  I was assuming the SpatialKeys would be in alignment so I could do operations between the two TileLayerRDD sets.  Does this sound logical?,3/25/16,1
lossyrob,"If they are both FloatingLayoutSchemes that were deteremined by the layers, no",3/25/16,1
lossyrob,but if they are both manually created LayoutDefinitions (e.g. you set the extent and resolution explicitly),3/25/16,1
lossyrob,or if they are ZoomedLayoutScheme for the same CRS,3/25/16,1
lossyrob,then yes,3/25/16,1
owcm,"Okay, I am using  ZoomedLayoutScheme",3/25/16,1
owcm,Should conceivably work then.,3/25/16,1
lossyrob,"yup, your good to go. If you were to join by keys, those tiles would align",3/25/16,1
owcm,"Well I will show my ignorance,  how do you do that?```val speedTPILCRDD = speedTPIRDD.localMultiply( lcModifiedRDD ).join()```",3/25/16,1

owcm,@echeipesh ,3/25/16,1
owcm,@echeipesh  Thanks,3/25/16,1
owcm,@echeipesh One thing I forgot to consider is that one set of data is 1 m and the other is 30m.  When dealing with individual tiles.  I have done a resample operation that has worked.   When things are in RDD format can you resample?,3/25/16,1
dwins,"Sorry guys, on a pretty bad internet connection right now. Today I was just planning on getting #1421 through review and seeing if there are any existing ignored tests in `proj4/src/test/` that could be enabled",3/25/16,1

lossyrob,@dwins that sounds good. I_„Žll be merging everything in and publishing tonight/tomorrow morning.,3/25/16,1
lossyrob,"We decided to go with an 0.10.0-RC3, since there was a bug discoverd in RC2 and Eugene suggested that we have a no-change RC before we do the final, which is a good idea.",3/25/16,1
dwins,+1 to the final release having no changes from the last RC,3/25/16,1
lossyrob,"@owcm if they_„Žre zoom leveled, they were resampled during ingest. So it_„Žs a matter of, are those layers at the same zoom level, then yes you can join, otherwise you_„Žll have to resample the smaller zoom to the bigger zoom",3/25/16,1
owcm,@lossyrob Ran a test and no they do not have the same zoom level.   The raster elevation 1m data is resolving to a Zoom level of 17.  The Landcover data that is at 30 meter when ingested  has a a zoom level of 13,3/25/16,1
owcm,@lossyrob so I guess the #L108 and #118 links to SinglebandTileMerge for my benefit?,3/25/16,1

lossyrob,"the way to do this would be to set up your spark cluster, then use the `./sbt assembly` command to build a fat jar (a jar that has all of the dependencies and everything baked in)",3/29/16,1
lossyrob,and then use `spark-submit`to submit the job to spark,3/29/16,1
lossyrob,"the landsat tutorial is not currently set up to run in a clustered environment, it was more exemplary of running spark in a local setting_„_so the level of effort to run it in a cluster is higher than setting config and running sbt run (although it is very possible, and I believe someone has already done so)",3/29/16,1

pomadchin,"@lokifacio we are concentrated on release, sry for slow replies :) guyz will have a look, thanks for your pr!",3/30/16,1
lokifacio,"@pomadchin sure, just asking him because he posted about the use case",3/30/16,1
lokifacio,"is there any chance it can be included in this release? if not, you should at least fix the median/mode CellWiseCalculation setValue method which uses setDouble instead of Int set",3/30/16,1
echeipesh,@lokifacio I_„Žm chewing on it. I think it makes a lot of sense that we have ability to do something like this in a single pass. Both keeping the region borders through focal calc and using focal calculations to fill in NoData regions make a lot of sense.,3/30/16,1
echeipesh,Alternatives require doing some masking pre/post operation and seem like they would be unweildy.,3/30/16,1
echeipesh,Have you ever seen cases where the decision to populate the cell is more comlicated? For instance dependant on the cell value  (other than data/nodata) or the value of cells in the focal neighborhood?,3/30/16,1
lokifacio,"No, although it could make sense for someone...I was considering passing a filter function instead but thought that would make the api less clear  for most common cases",3/30/16,1
echeipesh,"It_„Žs probably not going to make it into `0.10.0`, feature freeze is supposed to be activate right now. But the `0.10.1` is only 3 months away from release to get us into a more regular cycle.",3/30/16,1

owcm,"Seems like Geotrellis has support to read GeoJson files.   Is there an example anyone can point me to, to see how it is done.  Looking at Master code I did not see any clear examples.",3/30/16,1
dwins,there's an example of doing it with a String here: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/docs/vector/geojson-support.md,3/30/16,1
dwins,@owcm and you can see some places in the tests where a file is loaded to a String before being parsed with that approach. https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/vector-test/src/test/scala/spec/geotrellis/vector/dissolve/DissoveMethodsSpec.scala#L24,3/30/16,1
lossyrob,@lokifacio oh right. I thought that was the double version,3/30/16,1
lossyrob,actually,3/30/16,1
lossyrob,we don_„Žt have an Int/Double version,3/30/16,1
lossyrob,so it should be setDouble to handle both cases,3/30/16,1
lossyrob,thoguht it returns an IntArrayTileResult,3/30/16,1
lossyrob,which is not good if we have an incoming Double tile,3/30/16,1
lossyrob,seems like we should change that to have a Double tile case,3/30/16,1
lossyrob,"@owcm https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/docs/vector/geojson-support.md, if these docs don_„Žt handle your case or give you the right info, please let us know so we can update",3/30/16,1
lossyrob,,3/30/16,1
owcm,"@dwins,@lossyrob Thanks for the docs, I am following them. Thanks Let you know if I have issues.",3/30/16,1
owcm,"@lossyrob Followed the GeoJSON Feature example you supplied and was able to have that work.  I have shape files I converted using QGIS or OGR2OGR to geojson.

These converters don't add the ID field. I don't see the ID field as a required field in the GeoJSON spec, but it is there in your example.   Have you heard of this issue before?  In my case I am working with a file of LineStrings.",3/31/16,1
dwins,@owcm if you use `JsonFeatureCollectionMap`  then the ID is required because that is used for the map key,3/31/16,1
dwins,Parsing to `JsonFeatureCollection` as done in the test I linked should not have this requirement.,3/31/16,1
owcm,@dwins  Right you are.  I was to focused on the example. Thanks,3/31/16,1

lokifacio,I'm trying geotrellis on our cluster and it seems it is only using one executor even I have an RDD with 70 tiles,3/31/16,1
lokifacio,do I need to repartition it manually?,3/31/16,1
echeipesh,can you check how many partitions it actually has?,3/31/16,1
echeipesh,To answer the question we try to partition reasonably whenever it_„Žs possible but sometimes you have to do it manually. But also YARN in particular defaults to using only 2 executors and in cluster deploy mode that ends up with an executor for driver and one for the worker.,3/31/16,1
lokifacio,I'm launching with yarn --num-executors 40  and I get TileLayerRDD's  **count= 77** and **partitions.length=1**,3/31/16,1
echeipesh,"Yep, that not great partitioning, where are you reading it from?",3/31/16,1
lokifacio,hadoop ingested tiles ,3/31/16,1
echeipesh,fresh from ingest or from HadoopLayerReader ?,3/31/16,1
lokifacio,HadoopLayerReader,3/31/16,1
lokifacio,I have my own ingest code using HadoopLayerWriter,3/31/16,1
echeipesh,What is supposed to happen there is that the hadoop layer writer writes sequence file of hadoop block size (I think that_„Žs 64MB by default) and on read each block becomes it_„Žs own partition. If those are 256x256 tiles then they_„Žre only 40MB uncompressed together (assuming they_„Žre 8 bytes per cell). So in this case you_„Žd need to repartition them manually. There is no logic to enforce minimum partition count on read.,3/31/16,1
lokifacio,"why repartitioning a `TileLayerRDD[SpatialKey]` returns a `RDD[(Tile, Tile)]`?",3/31/16,1
pomadchin,Have you a code sample?,3/31/16,1
pomadchin,or just this type repatriation?,3/31/16,1
lokifacio,"```scalaval reader: HadoopLayerReader = ?reader.read(layer).repartition(20)```",3/31/16,1
echeipesh,"because it extends `RDD[(SpatialKey, Tile)]` so `repartition` is on base RDD class. To save the metadata try `rdd.withContext( _.repartition(20))`",3/31/16,1
lokifacio,"already tried that, but I got a `ContextRDD[Tile, Tile, Bounds[Tile]]` instead of a TileLayerRDD which I get when I use withContext with other ops",3/31/16,1
lokifacio,"@echeipesh what I meant was where the first Tile comes from,  `TileLayerRDD[SpatialKey]` is supposed to be `RDD[(SpatialKey, Tile)]`, isn't it?",3/31/16,1
echeipesh,"Sorry that doesn_„Žt sound right, so `reader.read(layer).withContext(_.repartition(20))` has result of that signature ?",3/31/16,1

echeipesh,"@mchendricks1 There should not be any API breakage between 1.5.2 and 1.5.0 so you should be gtg, but as I recall there were fairly major bugs that were fixed from 1.5.0 to 1.5.1 so hopefully that will not hit you.",4/11/16,1

pomadchin,will double check what_„Žs exactly wrong and why it happend,4/13/16,1
pomadchin,@shiraeeshi https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/issues/1445,4/13/16,1
lossyrob,"so currently the status quo, in geodockercluster and elsewhere, is to always run spark jobs through `spark-submit`, yeah?",4/13/16,1
pomadchin,"so that depends on situation o: but to avoid deps hell yes;anyway i believe that there could be cases, that spark-submit would crash too, because it forces app to use cluster deps",4/13/16,1
pomadchin,think that we should just manage cluster dependencies carefully ._.,4/13/16,1
lossyrob,"Could be; but this isn_„Žt the first time I_„Žve seen dep issues this way around, so I think we should be recommending using spark-submit by default, unless there is a good & specific reason not to",4/13/16,1
pomadchin,yep,4/13/16,1
lossyrob,"actually, to be fair, I have seen the other way too",4/13/16,1
lossyrob,"like the hadoop version we were installing with geotrellis-ec2-cluster, that had old joda time and aws dependencies",4/13/16,1
pomadchin,"yes, so probably we can point somewhere in docs, that we should be carefull with cluster provided libs",4/13/16,1
lossyrob,"so maybe dep hell is always unavoidable, though if we have to be consistent in one way vs the other, spark-submit and using the clusters dependencies seems to be the thing people do",4/13/16,1
lossyrob,yeah,4/13/16,1
lossyrob,has anyone seen this from geodocker-cluster?,4/14/16,1

pomadchin,"@rshirochenko that_„Žs `FileValueReader` now, related pr: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/pull/1437",4/20/16,1
echeipesh,"@akarmas At the time of that FOSDEM presentation we were were building a fat jar from the `geotrellis-spark`, since then we_„Žve factored out the project to make it a nicer dependency. So for instance it doesn_„Žt even have readers/writers for s3 as that would create a possible conflict with spark dependency. So as of right now the `spark-etl` project fat jar is the closest thing to what was being built there, so you_„Žre on the right track.",4/20/16,1
echeipesh,"@akarmas also if you are looking to use spark-shell to mess around with a local context you can just drop into sbt `console` in the `spark` project, you_„Žll get all the imports that are availble there. You can start a local spark context with `implicit val sc = geotrellis.spark.util.SparkUtils.createLocalSparkContext(_„ñlocal[*]_„, _„ñTest Context_„)` ",4/20/16,1

lokifacio,"I'm having a problem with the following workflow with a HDFS catalog: ingest - read - write- read raster  using `HadoopLayerWriter` and `HadoopLayerReader`. Initial ingest reports `float64ud-1.7E308` cell type and works fine, but tile layer metadata after second write reports `float64udInfinity` cell type, which fails on the subsequent read. I've checked the cell type parsing code and it doesn't handle Infinity value. I wonder where this should be fixed on metadata writing or on cell type parsing from string? ",4/22/16,1
echeipesh,"Sounds like both are a problem. Infinity is a value, so there should be a way for it to stand for NoData. And changing NoData values on write isn_„Žt correct either. I imagine it would throw off the `IsData` checking for these tiles when they_„Žre read after the second write.",4/22/16,1

ameetkini,"So there are a couple projects here looking to try out geotrellis and they don't have bandwidth to do any custom dev during the try-out phase, just ingest a few tiles and show them via a UI.

lossyrob,I_„Žm not too familiar with this viewer. but my guess is that there is a application.conf you need to modify with your settings,5/9/16,1
fosskers,it's the `settings.conf`,5/9/16,1
fosskers,default value for that field is `0.0.0.0`,5/9/16,1

lossyrob,which I_„Žm not finding a resources folder for that in the project,5/9/16,1
dwins,"Yes, normally it would be in `application.conf`",5/9/16,1
dwins,I made a separate `settings.conf` file that isn't packaged in the jar because it was easier to modify settings when I was copying the fat jar to a VM,5/9/16,1
dwins,I can fix this to be done in the usual way and also update to GT 0.10.0 real quick,5/9/16,1

fosskers,"Yeah @lossyrob , I'm familiar with its setup/deployment. @moradology is getting me more on board tomorrow",5/9/16,1

timothymschier,thanks @fosskers that will be something to look into for a future sprint... for now though I just need a really basic TMS server in order to demonstrate some early integration work,5/9/16,1
lossyrob,@timothymschier how are you deploying the spark that is running the service currently? Is it a single EC2 instance?,5/9/16,1
timothymschier,"I've got a geotrellis-ec2-cluster 1-leader 2-follower going on EC2, but I'm SSHd into the master and have built and was just going to run locally there",5/9/16,1
timothymschier,"so yeah, pretty clunky, but I had it there and figured that should work for this simple demo",5/9/16,1

dwins,@fosskers Updated master branch on that repo. Going to be AFK(laptop) for a moment but I have chat on my phone if there are any questions.,5/9/16,1
timothymschier,"hey @dwins, you missed geotrellis-raster version update in build.sbt",5/9/16,1
timothymschier,I'll do a pull request if you like,5/9/16,1
fosskers,"To clarify for @timothymschier (assuming that you're using `geotrellis-viewer`), what's upcoming is an updated version of `geotrellis-admin`, which is a little more robust than the old viewer and has nice docker-based deployment",5/9/16,1
lossyrob,which is good. but the simple TMS on geotrellis-ec2-cluster should work. It_„Žs very strange that it_„Žs reading a bad avro file,5/9/16,1

lossyrob,"best case is that it_„Žs just being fed a bad file, in which case it would be good to throw a more descriptive error message",5/9/16,1

timothymschier,cool @lossyrob  I'm about to give it a go with an updated geotrellis-viewer,5/9/16,1
lossyrob,ok cool,5/9/16,1

lossyrob,try to verify that the bucket/prefix that you_„Žre pulling from is correct.,5/9/16,1
lossyrob,Although it does seem like it_„Žs pulling the metadata correctly...,5/9/16,1
timothymschier,ok will double-check,5/9/16,1
dwins,@fosskers cool right. I can't merge for a few minutes but this PR looks good,5/9/16,1
fosskers,maybe talk to @moradology first,5/9/16,1
timothymschier,hrmm same problem,5/9/16,1
lossyrob,"@timothymschier to debug I would try to kick up a spark shell with that jar on the path, to try and poke around interactively. See if you can read a single tile. Or boot up EMR with Zeppelin and poke around there. Might be a bit tough if your unfamiliar with the library.

lossyrob,"@SDeathLeaDer if you could specify what you man by ""service doesn't found the tiles_„, that would help. e.g. is it just a 404? Does it say the resource is not found?

mchendricks1,I'm looking into digital globe WV-3 image processing because a heckler in a presentation I was giving basically asserted that if the Geotrillis RDD didn't in effect automatically tile say 2TB for distribution over several say m3.xlarge then it was doing anything useful. For whatever reasons we couldn't come to an agreement about sub-tiling before ingesting into Geotrellis. ,5/18/16,1

dwins,@pljplj for most uses we hope you won't need `jtsGeom`,5/25/16,1
pljplj,"ok, what is the correct way",5/25/16,1
dwins,I think it will work with just `poly difference line` or even `poly - line`,5/25/16,1
dwins,(on my phone right now so hard to verify code ,5/25/16,1
pljplj,Compiler doesn't like either of those,5/25/16,1
dwins,"Oh I see. In your code the geometries are typed as `Geometry`rather than the specific geometry types, but geotrellis does not offer the difference operation on generic geometries. You could use `as[Polygon]` to assert that the geometry is a polygon",5/25/16,1
dwins,Or you can just go with the JTS geometry: `poly.jtsGeom.difference(line.jtsGeom)`,5/25/16,1
pljplj,If I want to do it the proper scala way.   poly.as[Polygon] - line.as[Line] doesn't work.  What should try,5/25/16,1
dwins,`for (p <- poly.as[Polygon]; l <- line.as[Line]) yield p - l`,5/25/16,1
dwins,Gives an Option that is none if the types aren't what you expect ,5/25/16,1
pljplj,thanks -- it compiles now.  I must admit scala is pretty opaque.  That is bizarre for no purpose that I can see ,5/25/16,1
dwins,The idea is to model geometry operation types more precisely than just Geometry ÍÜ Geometry __ Geometry ,5/25/16,1
dwins,"So the compiler will verify that your codes doesn't expect anything other than a point when you take the intersection of a point and a polygon, etc ",5/25/16,1
pljplj,Well that sounds like a noble goal.  This example doesn't show it AFAIK.  p - l  could be anything.  I would have to dig into the '-' overload to find out what it might return.  In this case it is something totally different from anything I've ever seen before.  Maybe as I use scala more I'll be convinced,5/25/16,1
dwins,"Well, it is an example of how GeoTrellis has solved this problem - rather than returning a Geometry, `Polygon.difference` returns a `PolygonAtMostOneDimensionDifferenceResult`and that result type reflects the range of types that might be returned by taking a difference with a polygon",5/25/16,1
dwins,i agree this API is somewhat cumbersome,5/25/16,1
pljplj,thanks for the help.  ,5/25/16,1
dwins,@pljplj however you don't need to look at the code to find the return type. you can either ask the REPL with `:type` or prompt a compiler error that indicates the type by ascribing `Nothing` as the type,5/25/16,1
pljplj,"More for me to learn.       val diffLeft  = for (p <- left.as[Polygon]; l <- rightLine.as[Line]) yield p & ldiffLeft:type  -- doesn't work.  How would I use :type",5/25/16,1
dwins,@pljplj in a scala console session you can write `:type (any expression)`  to find the type of the expression,5/25/16,1

dwins,"you could use pattern matching to test for specific geometry types, or just treat it as a generic Geometry using `toGeometry`. But toGeometry actually gives an Option (because in Geotrellis we want to assume that Geometries are never empty, so we use None when the intersection is empty)",5/27/16,1
dwins,anyway i think you'd want something along the lines of `diffLeft.flatMap(_.toGeometry).get.jtsGeom.getCoordinates`,5/27/16,1

pljplj,well I don't just want to print it out.  I need to look at the points and save them.  This is the way I figure it out.  Programming scala sort of like java.  I printed out for debuggin so I could see what was going on,5/27/16,1
dwins,I see. Foreach is only useful when you only want to perform some side-effect like printing. if you want a value that can be used as a variable in other parts of the program you need other methods like map and flatMap,5/27/16,1
pljplj,So I can't put add to a collection when I find a point that I want in a foreach?,5/27/16,1

fosskers,"Proposed patch: catch on the number formatting exception as well, and/or move away from requiring `Int` here",6/7/16,1
echeipesh," Yes, and to be honest there should be a way to get that string from a ColorMap. I don_„Žt htink overwriting toString is justified, but something.",6/7/16,1
fosskers,I can do both,6/7/16,1
fosskers,"The `ColorMap => String` is a convenience. Say in `gt-admin` I have an established `ColorMap` that I like for a layer, and want to know its break string",6/7/16,1

fosskers,"In general, when one rendersto PNG some dataset they have, is the break string they'd need something they'd trivially know? Is me thinking ""no"" my inexperience?",6/7/16,1
lossyrob,nope. It_„Žs something that is usually calculated,6/7/16,1
fosskers,"thought so. I guess yeah, you'd get your RDD and call `.colorBreaks`",6/7/16,1
fosskers,"take that, pass it one of our ramp strings (""blue-to-orange"") to generate a `ColorMap`, and there you go",6/7/16,1
fosskers,"From within Scala it's just a matter of calling `renderPng` after that, but we're outside Scala here",6/7/16,1
fosskers,hence as @echeipesh said it would be good to have `ColorMap => String`,6/7/16,1
fosskers,"although this does suffer from chicken-and-egg a bit. You need to know your break string before you can process/render, but you can't get the break string until you process ;)",6/7/16,1
lossyrob,that_„Žs why PNG generation jobs written in code usually just do the histogram calculation on the tiles and then renders them through the zoom levels using that histogram,6/7/16,1
lossyrob,really instead of breaks we should be passing in numBreaks and a color ramp,6/7/16,1
lossyrob,"so that you calculate the histogram in ETL if it_„Žs rendering png or jpg and colors it by computing the histogram, getting the breaks, and then rendering it with the passed in color ramp",6/7/16,1
fosskers,Want me to change it?,6/7/16,1
fosskers,"a la:> really instead of breaks we should be passing in numBreaks and a color ramp",6/7/16,1
fosskers,"looking at the code here, that's very possible",6/7/16,1
echeipesh,"@lossyrob @fosskers The reason that is breaks is because the very first case was to render NCLD, a categorical dataset. That is a pretty legitimate usecase. so we_„Žd have to support both, not either.",6/7/16,1
fosskers,good point,6/7/16,1
echeipesh,"@akarmas Partial answer is that when a layer is saved it creates an index for transforming a key to some long via a space filing curve. The use of SFC is the core of our query mechanism. The restriction with SFCs is that they must index a bounded space. What happens is that when you write a layer the default behavior is to take the bounds of the data that is being written as the whole space. If an udpate happens outside of those bounds it can_„Žt be addressed, thus your error. The way to deal with this is to specify a wider bound when you initially write, forcing you to consider what kind of key ranges may be addressable.",6/7/16,1
echeipesh,"@akarmas Coding from the hip it would look something like this:```scala// maximum spatial extent we plan to addressval maxExtent: Extent = ???val minDate: DateTime = ???val maxDate: DateTime = ???// Use our layout to transform an extent to tile col/rows boundsval GridBounds(colMin, rowMin, colMax, rowMax) = rdd.metadata.layout.mapTransform(maxExtent)// Build the space we need to be able to addressval updateBounds: KeyBounds[SpaceTimeKey] =  KeyBounds(SpaceTimeKey(colMin, rowMin, minDate, SpaceTimeKey(colMax, rowMax, maxDate))// Choose a method to decompose addressable space into series of sub-spaces indexed by an SFCval keyIndex: KeyIndex[SpaceTimeKey] = ZSpaceTimeKeyIndex.byMonth(updateBounds) //..byMonthish, does not break on month endlayerWriter.write(layerId, rdd, keyIndex)```",6/7/16,1
echeipesh,"You don_„Žt have to worry overly about collisions in the index. Any `(K,V)` that share the same index will be written together and will be read together and post-filetered for the query. So the shouldn_„Žt be TOO many for obvious reasons, but some are acceptable.",6/7/16,1
lossyrob,^- this has to be on the initial write of the layer,6/7/16,1

schBen,HiI have raster data (GeoTiff) and want to get an Isodata clustering. In Spark's MLlib I found a KMeans.scala that looks helpful. It expects an RDD[org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.Vector]. Can I use GeoTrellis to bring the GeoTiff into this format?,6/9/16,1
lossyrob,"hey @schBen, yeah you can get the raster into an RDD using GeoTrellis",6/9/16,1
lossyrob,converting it to a set of linalg.Vector after that is possible,6/9/16,1
lossyrob,are you trying to pull point data out of the geotiffs and then run the kmeans?,6/9/16,1
lossyrob,"I_„Žm not very familiar with isodata clustering, looks like a pixel based algorithm. it might actually be more convenient/faster to write the algorithm against the raster tiles instead of trying to convert to vectors",6/9/16,1
lossyrob,"the RDD[org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.Vector] element type (Vector) represents a N-D point, so you could represent pixels as `[col, row, value]` vectors, or even `[lat, lng, value]` vectors if there_„Žs any benefit in being in the map space instead of grid space, and run the kmeans over those elements",6/9/16,1
lossyrob,"probably would be better to be in map space, the cluster algo outputs could then be interpolated back onto grid space",6/9/16,1
lossyrob,more precision,6/9/16,1
lossyrob,"but yeah if kmeans is just a starting point, it might be interesting to imagine the isodata clustering algorithm on an `RDD[(SpatialKey, Tile)]` or `RDD[(SpatialKey, MultibandTile)]` instead of doing the conversion. But if MLLib has what you need, you_„Žd be able to convert. I can point you to the relavent code for reading geotiffs into RDDs off of the local file system, HDFS or S3, and the convert logic. Is it singleband or multiband raster data?",6/9/16,1
schBen,"@lossyrob It's multiband raster data. I start with multiband GeoTiffs for now. I think in the k means vectors, the components are spectral, so that one vector represents the different bands from the multiband raster. So my question is how to map the bands of the GeoTiff to the vector components. I'm still not sure how the spatial information is preserved. Of course it would be better to have an isodata algorithm for RDD[(SpatialKey, Tile)] already :-)",6/9/16,1

lossyrob,"@owcm would it be desirable to have a custom merging function in there? I_„Žve thought about that before, it_„Žs not implemented though",6/9/16,1
lossyrob,"@schBen there_„Žs a couple ways to go about this. One path forward is, you would first need to get to an `RDD[(ProjectedExtent, MultibandTile)]` using some geotrellis methods for reading in the geotiff tile. You can do that by reading in the geotiff just like how this is doing: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis-landsat-tutorial/blob/master/src/main/scala/tutorial/IngestImage.scala#L60",6/9/16,1

akarmas,"Hi all, i have a question!i am reading in a layer with two Int bands like this```val irdd1: RDD[(SpaceTimeKey, MultibandTile)] with Metadata[TileLayerMetadata[SpaceTimeKey]] =        reader.query[SpaceTimeKey, MultibandTile, TileLayerMetadata[SpaceTimeKey]](layerId).where(Between(time1, time2)).result```Then i want to perform a simple processing to the bands of the RDD i.e. to calculate the NDVI for the layer and produce a new RDD[(SpaceTimeKey, Tile)] with Metadata[TileLayerMetadata[SpaceTimeKey]]  with the same metadata as the original but with the NDVI values as the the tile values. I am performing the processing like this:```val test = MultibandTileLayerRDD(irdd1, irdd1.metadata)val i = test map { case(key, tile) =>  tile.convert(DoubleCellType).combineDouble(0, 1) {              (r, ir) => if(isData(r) && isData(ir)) {               (ir - r) / (ir + r)             } else {                 Double.NaN             }}  } collect()```But it is not working. The conversion to double does not work and as a consequence the resulting tiles have zero values everywhere.What am i doing wrong?Thanks! ",6/13/16,1

owcm,@pomadchin Thanks again that saved me,6/13/16,1
lossyrob,@akarmas so when you iterate through `i` all the tile values have 0 data? or are you stitching?,6/13/16,1
lossyrob,@akarmas you can try converting at the top level as well - `test.convert(DoubleConstantNoDataCellType)`,6/13/16,1
aeffrig,I'm working with the Landsat data.  I've ingested each of the single band images into Accumulo with ETL.  Once the data is in Acculumo is there any way to join it together to  run the NDVI calculation and then treated it as multiband without reconstituting it as a single multiband image?,6/13/16,1
lossyrob,I_„Žm having trouble seeing why that wouldn_„Žt work,6/13/16,1
lossyrob,"@akarmas can you write out the initial collection of multiband tiles as a sequence of geotiffs and then pass them to us somehow? I_„Žm reading through the code and I can_„Žt figure out what would be causing that, would like to test locally",6/13/16,1
echeipesh,"@aeffrig sure you_„Žd have to query each band seperatly, since they_„Žre each their own layer, and then join the NIR and VIS (docs on joins: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/docs/spark/spark-joins.md) then you can mape over the result and do something like `rdd.mapValues{ case (nir, vis) => nir.combineDouble(vis){ (pixelNir, pixelVis) => (pixelNir - pixelVix) / (pixelNir + pixelVis) } }` ",6/13/16,1

akarmas,"@lossyrob Ok, this confusion is my mistake. Everything works fine. I was using asciiDraw() to inspect tile values instead of asciiDrawDouble() and that is why i thought the conversion was not working.I 'm really sorry for that!!From the above code snippet i is of type Array[geotrellis.raster.Tile]. How can i transform it to RDD[SpaceTimeKey, Tile] where the SpaceTimeKey is the same as the original key of each tile in irdd1?",6/14/16,1

I am trying to do it as follows in the code(with temporalMAX) but it does not work. Each date has 546 tiles that belong to the image of that date. So i think that the result must contain also 546 tiles that hold the max values for each pixel but this is not the case as the way i am doing it the result has 1092 tiles which does not make sense. Also i cannot understand how to use the windowSize, unit and partitioner arguments of temporalMax function```val irdd: RDD[(SpaceTimeKey, Tile)] with Metadata[TileLayerMetadata[SpaceTimeKey]] =        reader.read[SpaceTimeKey, Tile, TileLayerMetadata[SpaceTimeKey]](layerId)import geotrellis.spark.mapalgebra.local.temporal._val m = LocalTemporalStatistics.temporalMax[SpaceTimeKey](irdd, 1, 1, time1, time3) val c = m.collect```",6/14/16,1
lossyrob,"@akarmas you don_„Žt want to collect if you don_„Žt have to. You can just stay in RDD land. When you collect, you are shipping all of your tiles back to the driver program.

fosskers,I'll elaborate on my protobuf trials here,6/14/16,1
fosskers,"Here's an update. I used [mapbox-vector-tile](https://github.com/mapzen/mapbox-vector-tile), a mapzen tool in Python, to encode a simple object:```python vt = {     ""name"": ""water"",     ""features"": [         {             ""geometry"":""POINT(5 5)"",             ""properties"": {}         }     ] }```",6/14/16,1
fosskers,"I then wrote the encoded bytes to a file, and decoded them with both my hand-written VT schema, and the autogenerated one",6/14/16,1
fosskers,"*Both* report the point to be at (5, 4041) instead",6/14/16,1
fosskers,"Here's what's curious. A point at `(5,5)` would be encoded as `[9 10 10]`. `9` says ""move relative to where you are (`(0,0)` at the start), and expect 1 pair of x,y coords""",6/14/16,1
fosskers,10 is the z-encoded form of 5,6/14/16,1
fosskers,10 in binary is `.... 0000 1010` (these are uint32),6/14/16,1
fosskers,"the mistaken coordinate read by both my backends above, 4041, would be encoded as 8182",6/14/16,1
fosskers,8182 in binary is `.... 0001 1111 1111 0110`,6/14/16,1
lossyrob,could this be an endian problem,6/14/16,1
fosskers,the binary for 10 isn't found within the binary for 8182,6/14/16,1
fosskers,"so it's not like my backends were ""reading more bits than they were supposed to"" etc",6/14/16,1
fosskers,"> endian problemMy code and the python code agreed on everything else except this one y-coord",6/14/16,1
lossyrob,"yeah, speghetti at the wall",6/14/16,1
fosskers,"and since it's all just ints, an endian problem would (should) blow the whole thing apart",6/14/16,1
lossyrob,is it a y axis flip problem,6/14/16,1
lossyrob,upper or lower based 0 value,6/14/16,1
fosskers,doubt it,6/14/16,1
fosskers,"my next step is to write out some of my mock instances via my protobuf code, and see if the python can read them",6/14/16,1
fosskers,"if it can't, then I think their tool is to blame in this case",6/14/16,1
fosskers,and I'd have to restart my search for a working 3rd party codec,6/14/16,1
lossyrob,dang,6/14/16,1
fosskers,"> Both report the point to be at (5, 4041) insteadMakes me suspect the python code",6/14/16,1
fosskers,"So I took a test instance of some protobuf data, encoded it, and read it with the python tool",6/14/16,1
fosskers,"The test instance encodes a single point at `(25,17)`",6/14/16,1
fosskers,"the python tool read it as being at `(25,4079)`",6/14/16,1
fosskers,waiiiiit a minute,6/14/16,1
fosskers,The default extent for these tiles is 4096,6/14/16,1
fosskers,`4096 - 17 = 4079`,6/14/16,1
fosskers,"In fact, the range of points is supposed to be `[0,4096)`",6/14/16,1
fosskers,No,6/14/16,1
fosskers,"> A point at (0,10) or (4096,10) is on the edge of the extent. A point at (-1,10) or (4097,10) is outside the extent of the tile.",6/14/16,1
fosskers,"So the range *is* `[0,4096]`",6/14/16,1
fosskers,interesting that that requires 4079 points,6/14/16,1
fosskers,"From the python tool's README:> geometry: representation of the feature geometry in WKT, WKB, or a shapely geometry. Coordinates are relative to the tile, scaled in the range [0, 4096).",6/14/16,1
lossyrob,you sure it_„Žs not a Y up-or-down problem? Similar to https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/raster/src/main/scala/geotrellis/raster/RasterExtent.scala#L32 . The math of `4096 - 17 = 4079` makes me even more suspicious,6/14/16,1
fosskers,you're right,6/14/16,1
fosskers,https://github.com/mapzen/mapbox-vector-tile/blob/1c9d86945c9d581f36ebcf997c889c44cb605111/README.md#coordinate-transformations-for-encoding,6/14/16,1
fosskers,"> It is possible to control whether the tile is in a ""y down"" coordinate system by setting the parameter y_coord_down=True on the call to encode(). The default is ""y up"".",6/14/16,1
fosskers,ok! got it,6/14/16,1
lossyrob,well that_„Žs at least one part,6/14/16,1
lossyrob,wonder why that would crash the reader on that large complex tile,6/14/16,1
fosskers,my protobuf codec reads the correct coords from `onepoint.mvt` now,6/14/16,1
lossyrob,nice,6/14/16,1
fosskers,(the hand-written one),6/14/16,1
fosskers,but they still aren't the same binary,6/14/16,1
fosskers,"ok, the python tool can also decode my encoded mock instance",6/14/16,1
fosskers,"After a lot of pencil, paper, and base-2 math, I've discovered the problem with https://github.com/mapzen/mapbox-vector-tile is how it handles polygons",6/14/16,1
fosskers,"V2 of the spec clarified how polygon winding order is supposed to work. Namely, given some list of `uint32` defining a polygon geometry:```[9 4 4 18 6 4 5 4 15]```",6/14/16,1
fosskers,"Those ints encode ""move"" commands and coordinate diffs from some ""cursor"" location",6/14/16,1
fosskers,"These ints encode the polygon `(2,2) -> (5,4) -> (2,6) -> (2,2)`",6/14/16,1
fosskers,"however, with that y-flippage business we found before, it seems the python tool confuses winding order",6/14/16,1
fosskers,encoding the above poly as `[9 4 4 18 0 8 6 3 15]`,6/14/16,1
fosskers,"which, when read by my code, gives the oppositely wound poly: `(2,2) -> (2,6) -> (5,4) -> (2,2)`",6/14/16,1
fosskers,"that poly gives a negative area by the surveyor's formula, and so should be an interior polygon (except it isn't)",6/14/16,1
lossyrob,so in v1 it didn_„Žt matter or was unspecified behavior? which is why the python lib is still at v1?,6/14/16,1
fosskers,"wow, okay, I just took a look at the v1 spec. It's about a quarter the length of the v2",6/14/16,1
fosskers,"and yeah, there's no mention of winding order at all",6/14/16,1
fosskers,meaning winding order / results of SF for determing interior rings is fair game,6/14/16,1
fosskers,https://github.com/mapzen/mapbox-vector-tile/issues/57,6/14/16,1
lossyrob,_„ñThe Puzzle of Winding Order_„ ha I like that. sounds like an adventure tale,6/14/16,1

fosskers,I'm going to sit on that over night and see what happens,6/14/16,1
fosskers,"The bug is fairly clear, so that's almost out of the way. A bigger issue is why my codecs wouldn't read the ""official"" tile",6/14/16,1

It_„Žs unfortunate that we would become dependant on those projects merging the PRs in order for the `geotrellis-python` projects to work, just because it_„Žs unclear when that would happen.The changes in the `avro` and `python-avro-json-serializer` projects are the enhancements for the authors, but for me these are bug fixes because it makes the logic more correct. There is an [issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AVRO-1777) in the jira board for the `avro` project that my PR closes. The change in `python-avro-json-serializer` is as simple as changing `schema.name` to `schema.fullname` in some single line in the code.The changes in the `spec` are enhancements, we could do without them, but there would be a lot more repetitions in the code just to make the `spec` happy.I think these changes belong to those projects, not to `geotrellis-python`, so changing that projects makes the code in `geotrellis-python` more clean and neat than if we tried to monkey-patch the changes without creating the PRs.There is some progress in [`spec`](https://github.com/bitprophet/spec/pull/40) and [`python-avro-json-serializer`](https://github.com/linkedin/python-avro-json-serializer/pull/2). (sorry for the delay with an answer, I have been checking the chat in the PR and forgot about this chat)",6/17/16,1

echeipesh,@aeffrig is that the only thing you had to change to build vs spark 1.6 ?,6/23/16,1
pomadchin,@echeipesh mb we can make a separate branch with 1.6 support?,6/23/16,1
echeipesh,"The plan was to upgrade to 1.6 after _„ñ0.10.0_„ release, we just haven_„Žt looked at that yet. If that_„Žs all that takes there is no problem with merging that into master and bumping our support to 1.6",6/23/16,1

echeipesh," @owcm: heh, I just meant that IO will almost always dominate code like this, so parsing JSON AST into a case class instance would barely register. But as far as code above there is nothing wrong with it. You could move the `aspectColorBreaks` var outside of the service, basically everything that is inside a spray directive that is parametarized will be re-calculated on every request. Not totally sure if typesafe config caches in the manner that we do, so could be splitting hairs there. Also you will eventually want to return a future on a different execution context than the spray actors sit on, unless thats what `getTile` already does.

aaron-santos,Hi guys. I'm trying to ingest sentinel2 basetiles and I could use a little guidance,7/6/16,1
aaron-santos,I'm also trying to do it in < ~8GB of ram so I can test it on my workstation before deploying :D,7/6/16,1
aaron-santos,"The input is a set of differently sized jp2 images, one for each of the 13 bands",7/6/16,1
aaron-santos,"The workflow goes like this:use java gdal bindings to read the raster dimensions and find the max (width, height) of all the bands",7/6/16,1
aaron-santos,"use gdalwarp to resize them to maxwidth, maxheight and also convert to geotiff",7/6/16,1
aaron-santos,use gdal_retile.py to slice each of the bands into 256x256 chunks,7/6/16,1
aaron-santos,transpose the sets of chunks so that I have a sequence of stacks of these chunks,7/6/16,1

akarmas,"@lossyrob  @echeipesh I have noticed that when a layer is updated (with HadoopLayerUpdater for example) all the already stored tiles in the layer are examined in order to be merged with the new data so that the new updated layer can be created.The problem is that as the layer grows the amount of HDFS storage needed as temporary storage for the update to be performed grows exponentially. With my hadoop conf for instance in order to update a 3GB layer with new data of 600MB almost 15GB of free  HDFS space are required.I was wondering if there is a point in further extending the update function with a (sort of) append mode, so that if the user is certain that there is no overlapping between the keys of the tiles already stored in a layer and in the keys of the tiles that are going to update the layer (for example when a layer that holds all L8 images of a specific path/row is updated with a new acquistion) the update process will result in a simple writing of the new tiles in the existing layer instead of re-reading the whole layer.What are your thoughts on this issue?Thanks!",7/8/16,1

akarmas,"Thank you all for the info!! @echeipesh I am not committed to HDFS. I just used it because i thought it was simpler to do so than use Accumulo. But i have also installed Accumulo so i ll just change the function calls in my code from io.hadoop to io.accumulo. I suppose that the process will be pretty straightforward.One question though in  ```AccumuloAttributeStore(connector: Connector, attributeTable: String) ```what should i put as connector and attributeTable?Moreover, in AccumuloLayerWriter what is the correct practice in setting the table that the data are to be written?Should i use one table per layer? and tables are to be created from accumulo shell or AccumuloLayerWriter is responsible for creating the table if the table does not exist?",7/11/16,1

echeipesh,"@schBen: The hadoop S3 implemintation is somewhat of a mess. `s3n` came first and it has multiple problems. `s3a` uses amazon SDK to implement the connection and in some ways it is better but still has issues. Sorry for the really vaigue answer, it was a while since I looked at it, but AFAIR somehow the hadoop `FileSystem` object will end up listing the whole bucket to get just one file and that leads to silly slow lookups you_„Žre seeing. To side step this ugly issue we created an `s3` project to read files from S3 directly using aws SDK: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/tree/master/s3/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/io/s3 I don_„Žt think we have created convinience methods for them, so you would have to lean on using the `sc.newAPIHadoopFile` and one of the InputFormats.",7/11/16,1
echeipesh,"@akarmas: One cool trick with Accumulo is that if you store multiple layers in the same table (they have to share KeyBounds and KeyIndexMethod though) when you query across them they will come up _„ñlineup_„ across the cluster. This happens because Accumulo is a columnar store and a single row will never get split across multiple machines. Other than that there is no hard guidance. Generally you shouldn_„Žt store more than _„ña dozen_„ of layers per table, you would see a performance decrease from that. By specifying the table in the writer it will be created for you.",7/11/16,1

lossyrob,@wsf1990 what you are seeing are the GeoTrellis constants that represent NoData,7/11/16,1
lossyrob,"for integer values, this is a constant defined as `NODATA`, which is equal to `Int.MinValue`",7/11/16,1
lossyrob,"for Doubles, NoData is `Double.NaN`",7/11/16,1
lossyrob,this is how we represent NoData as far as interacting with Tiles through the interface,7/11/16,1
lossyrob,Tiles can have underlying values that represent NoData in different ways,7/11/16,1
lossyrob,"for instance, `ByteUserDefinedNoDataCellType(-9.toByte)` would internally be a Byte array that had values of -9 representing NoData",7/11/16,1
lossyrob,"however, if you were to do a `tile.get(0, 0)` on the tile, which produces an integer value, and internally that value was -9, you would get a NODATA returned from the `get` call",7/11/16,1
lossyrob,"if you did `tile.getDouble(0, 0)` in the same scenario, you_„Žd get `Double.NaN`",7/11/16,1
lossyrob,the fact you get NODATA from ` tile.findMinMax` makes me think your tile is empty,7/11/16,1

lossyrob,nice Erik was one of two original GeoTrellis developers,7/11/16,1
longcao,i'm not entirely sure of the extent of what kind of queries I'd need (it might just need to preserve geometries to be moved into PostgreSQL) but at the very least I'd like to know if geotrellis would be capable of handling that over Spark?,7/11/16,1
lossyrob,might be a good fit: if you_„Žre doing geospatial in Scala then I_„Žm sure we have something for you,7/11/16,1
lossyrob,"mainly we deal with raster data, but are currently implementin vector data operations in Spark as well",7/11/16,1
lossyrob,"when you say _„ñfrom shapefiles in spark_„, what do you mean? what would be the RDD type?",7/11/16,1
longcao,sorry - let me be clearer,7/11/16,1
longcao,my concrete example is: http://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data.page#pluto,7/11/16,1
longcao,i'd have this MapPLUTO Shapefile data sitting in S3,7/11/16,1
longcao,so I'm wondering if there's an `RDD` type that Geotrellis would support,7/11/16,1
longcao,(i would dig through source but admittedly i got a little lost :)),7/11/16,1
lossyrob,"so your taking a CSV file of feature data (points? lines? polygons? a mix?) and trying to do some operations on them, and then dump results into PostGis?",7/11/16,1
lossyrob,oh sorry MapPLUTO,7/11/16,1
lossyrob,"we have a Scala Shapefile reader, we can also read GeoJSON",7/11/16,1
lossyrob,turn that into feature data types,7/11/16,1
lossyrob,"and then you would have an `RDD[Feature[Geometry, Map[String, Object]]]` that you could work with",7/11/16,1
lossyrob,we also have a set of Slick funtionality for interacting with PostGIS,7/11/16,1
lossyrob,"so if it_„Žs a matter of reading shapefiles then writing data into PostGIS, that could be accomplished in Spark..but there_„Žs not a lot that Spark is doing in this case (just reading from S3 and piping into PostGIS)",7/11/16,1
lossyrob,"what we don_„Žt currently have is a Shapefile s3 RDD loader that is nice, like we do with GeoTiffs, so that would be a bit of a manual process of reading the bytes via a S3Client and reading that as a shapefile.",7/11/16,1
longcao,"ah - ok, that's fine to me",7/11/16,1
longcao,i'm really more getting a feel for if these things are possible :D,7/11/16,1
longcao,before i head down a rabbit hole,7/11/16,1

echeipesh,@pljplj if `tiles` is a `Seq` there is no `reduceByKey` in scala collections. If `tiles` is and `RDD` than likely you need to `import org.apache.spark._` to get extension methods from `PairRDDMethods` to get `reduceByKey`.,7/14/16,1

I then edited the 1-zookeeper.sh file to get the output of the container execution and I get `/sbin/entrypoint.sh: line 6: /data/zookeeper/myid: Permission denied`.

Also, there are other files with the same prefix that I don't need (I guess). So how should I get multi(bandTile) RDDs efficiently if I just need all the bands? Should I read in every file as a single band RDD and then join them all? (In the end I want to do this for multiple scenes in parallel)",7/19/16,1
ardilgulez,I am on a similar thing myself and that's kinda what's bugging me. I need different combinations for different types of analyses so what I'm going to will be to get some sort of utility to download bands for me and trigger a re-tiling operation.,7/19/16,1

aaron-santos,"I'm creating one spatial layer per image captured by the satellite, but that results in a lot of layers in my catalog. I'm wondering if I can/should move to creating one layer indexed by space-time and if that would even be possible",7/21/16,1
aaron-santos,I don't exactly know the space-time extent upfront and I'm not sure how that would play into things or if that's even possible,7/21/16,1
ardilgulez,You need to do the indexing yourself,7/21/16,1
ardilgulez,It's really not that difficult though,7/21/16,1
echeipesh,"@aaron-santos Sure, basically you just need to provide some way to generate a `SpaceTimeKey`. You can do that either by providing `TemporalProjectedExtent` instead of `ProjectedExtent` before your ingest or to map over keys and map from `SpatialKey` to `SpaceTimeKey` after the ingest. The result would be pretty much the same.",7/21/16,1
echeipesh,"The only thing to be aware of is that you should specifify the max space-time bounds when creating the layer, covering the anticipated range of time, otherwise it_„Žs going to use the bounds of the first layer written and that_„Žs not going to be useful as it will reject updates out of those bounds.",7/21/16,1
aaron-santos,"gotcha. It sounds like if I establish those upfront, then I should be add additional data as it comes in as long as it has a `SpaceTimeKey`",7/21/16,1
echeipesh,"yep, exactly right.",7/21/16,1
aaron-santos,Cool. Once I have some data ingested will I be able to query for available times given a `ProjectedExtent`?,7/21/16,1
echeipesh,"Also worth noting is that since time does not have a set resolution you_„Žre going to have to define it when creating your `KeyIndexMethod`, it should be about related to frequency of your imagery updates.",7/21/16,1
aaron-santos,"If I set it too wide, then my `SpaceTimeKey`s might collide?",7/21/16,1
echeipesh,@aaron-santos You will be able to use the query syntax like so: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/test/scala/geotrellis/spark/io/LayerQuerySpec.scala#L36 but you_„Žll be able to also use `Between` caluse to specify a time range.,7/21/16,1
echeipesh,"They will collide, but what that means is that collisions will be stored in the same block. Very similar logic and trade-off to binning HashTable",7/21/16,1
echeipesh,"so if its 2-5 collisions it_„Žs mostly _„ñmeh_„, if it_„Žs couple of hunrdred you_„Žre probably going to be doing a lot more IO than your queries require.",7/21/16,1
aaron-santos,Nice. That's way better than what I was thinking was going to happen,7/21/16,1
echeipesh,"It makes writes a little expensive because we have to force a shuffle to detect collisions, but its WAY more useful than just randomly overwriting and losing imagery. At least that was our opinion.",7/21/16,1

lossyrob,"imagery processing is a whole other topic in GIS, I mainly did raster processing like suitability maps and hydrology operations over elevation at first. got into imagery afterwards",7/26/16,1
lossyrob,it_„Žs a really cool place to be right now,7/26/16,1
ardilgulez,"as for docs, spark related stuff just doesn't fit into my head",7/26/16,1
ardilgulez,and docs about it lack some meat tbh,7/26/16,1
lossyrob,do you have a pretty solid understanding of Apache Spark itself?,7/26/16,1
ardilgulez,nothing on spark itself,7/26/16,1
lossyrob,"good to note, we_„Žll have to add some meat",7/26/16,1
ardilgulez,gotta work on that too,7/26/16,1
lossyrob,that would probably be good - we are just enhancing Spark to deal with raster layers. Most of the heavy lifting is done by Spark,7/26/16,1
ardilgulez,yeah,7/26/16,1
ardilgulez,the queries on raster layers and stuff,7/26/16,1
lossyrob,"The querying is pretty complicated, in that it goes through some code that is quite awesome but hard to grok. very scala type-level stuff",7/26/16,1
lossyrob,"but it all comes down to taking a 2D or 3D bounding box, and then turning it into KeyBounds",7/26/16,1
lossyrob,and turning the KeyBounds into a set of Space Filling Curve index ranges,7/26/16,1
lossyrob,and querying the backend according to that,7/26/16,1
ardilgulez,where do i learn what Keybounds and Space Filling Curve index ranges are,7/26/16,1
lossyrob,good question...,7/26/16,1
lossyrob,Space Filling Curves is a whole thing. I_„Žll get some links together,7/26/16,1
lossyrob,"but that is how we take 2D and 3D queries (N-Dimensionsal in theory) and turn them into a set of 1-D range queries, which can be applied to a backend",7/26/16,1
lossyrob,Both GeoWave and GeoMesa use a similar technique,7/26/16,1
lossyrob,http://ngageoint.github.io/geowave/documentation.html#theory,7/26/16,1
lossyrob,That should explain SFC_„Žs to some detail.,7/26/16,1
lossyrob,"We have 2 types of keys: `SpatialKey` and `SpaceTimeKey`. Both have a tile `col` and `row`, and `SpaceTimeKey` has a time element to it. KeyBounds are simply a `minKey` and `maxKey` bounds in the key space. So really representing a bounding box, but in tile coordinates (and also time if we_„Žre dealing with SpaceTimeKey)",7/26/16,1
ardilgulez,tile coordinates = epsg 3857?,7/26/16,1
lossyrob,tile coordinates are according to some tile layout,7/26/16,1
lossyrob,`TileLayout`,7/26/16,1
lossyrob,"so `SpatialKey(5, 6)` represents the tile at column 5, row 6",7/26/16,1
ardilgulez,uh huh,7/26/16,1
lossyrob,"so there_„Žs a translation between map coordinates (somehting like EPSG 3857), and tile coordinates",7/26/16,1
ardilgulez,aha,7/26/16,1
lossyrob,these are used in web maps accordint to specific tile layouts,7/26/16,1
lossyrob,often called a `TMS` layout,7/26/16,1
ardilgulez,"so SpatialKey(5, 6) means {z}/5/6",7/26/16,1
lossyrob,"although that is slightly a misnomer, I won_„Žt get too deep into that",7/26/16,1
lossyrob,yeah,7/26/16,1
lossyrob,z/x/y,7/26/16,1
lossyrob,"so the zoom, which we actually hold in the `LayerId`",7/26/16,1
lossyrob,"and the `x/y` would translate to `SpatialKey(x, y)`",7/26/16,1
lossyrob,"so you could think of a query being like, from `4/3/5` to `4/5/9`",7/26/16,1
lossyrob,"i.e. `KeyBounds(SpatialKey(3, 4), SpatialKey(5, 9))`",7/26/16,1
ardilgulez,what about queries within a single tile?,7/26/16,1
lossyrob,"and those KeyBounds could be derived from some Extent (bounding box in map coordinates), and the metadata about the tile layout",7/26/16,1
lossyrob,You use a `ValueReader` for that,7/26/16,1
lossyrob,and just query according to the single key,7/26/16,1
lossyrob,"```scalaval reader = S3ValueReader(bucket, prefix).reader(LayerId(_„ñsome-name_„, zoomeLevel))reader.read(SpatialKey(3,4))```",7/26/16,1
lossyrob,for instance,7/26/16,1
lossyrob,"that reader call needs type parameters, but that_„Žs the basic idea",7/26/16,1
ardilgulez,"reader.read returns a single tile, right",7/26/16,1
ardilgulez,?,7/26/16,1
lossyrob,yes,7/26/16,1
lossyrob,the reader is for a specific LayerId,7/26/16,1
lossyrob,"the `ValueReader` is actually somethig that produces those types of readers, given an LayerId",7/26/16,1
ardilgulez,"which gets layer name and zoom level, and using spatial key 3,4",7/26/16,1
ardilgulez, i get a single tile,7/26/16,1
lossyrob,yup,7/26/16,1
ardilgulez,what about querying on extents,7/26/16,1
lossyrob,"You use a LayerReader, e.g. `S3LayerReader`",7/26/16,1
lossyrob,and use the query syntax,7/26/16,1
ardilgulez,oh yeah,7/26/16,1
ardilgulez,that's what happens in landsat-emr-demo example,7/26/16,1

ardilgulez,how can i obtain tiles only for an extent,7/28/16,1
lossyrob,obtain tiles from where?,7/28/16,1
lossyrob,what do you have to draw tiles from?,7/28/16,1
ardilgulez,I have tiles ready set and go,7/28/16,1
ardilgulez,I just want to serve only the parts that are enclosed by some geometry,7/28/16,1
lossyrob,"tiles as in - geotiffs, or as in an ingested layer",7/28/16,1
ardilgulez,ingested layer,7/28/16,1
lossyrob,nice,7/28/16,1
lossyrob,so you use the query syntax,7/28/16,1
lossyrob,and a LayerReader,7/28/16,1
lossyrob,I_„Žll point you at an example,7/28/16,1
lossyrob,https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis-landsat-emr-demo/blob/master/server/src/main/scala/demo/DemoServiceActor.scala#L144,7/28/16,1
lossyrob,"instead of `catalog` you_„Žd have your `LayerReader`, e.g. `S3LayerReader`",7/28/16,1
lossyrob,which you_„Žll have to create an instance of,7/28/16,1
ardilgulez,I'm using the same example,7/28/16,1
lossyrob,"ok. so instead of saying `Intersects(extent)`, you would give it some polygon",7/28/16,1
ardilgulez,yeah,7/28/16,1
ardilgulez,and I want to serve it as a tile layer,7/28/16,1
ardilgulez,like the tile route in the same class,7/28/16,1
lossyrob,well tile routes are served per-tile,7/28/16,1
lossyrob,"so is it jus that you want a tile layer, that only shows tiles that intersect with some geom?",7/28/16,1
ardilgulez,yes,7/28/16,1
ardilgulez,I think I can use tile.mask for that thing,7/28/16,1
lossyrob,well that will mask it,7/28/16,1
lossyrob,but you want to avoid fetching any tile that doesn_„Žt intersect with the geo,7/28/16,1
lossyrob,"so if a tile request is made for a non-intersecting tile, it_„Žll just return a 404",7/28/16,1
lossyrob,"in that case, you want to check the incoming spatial key, see if it intersects the geom, if so, fetch the tile, then mask by the geom",7/28/16,1
lossyrob,you_„Žll need to grab the layer_„Žs metadata to get the `mapTransform` to translate from keys to map coordinates,7/28/16,1
ardilgulez,tile.mask asks for both an extent and a geometry,7/28/16,1
ardilgulez,why,7/28/16,1
lossyrob,because tile_„Žs don_„Žt carry their position info,7/28/16,1
lossyrob,"`Raster[Tile]` does. it_„Žs a composition of an extent and a tile. You should be able to call `mask` on a `Raster[Tile]` with just the geom. but for a tile, you have to pass in that tile_„Žs extent",7/28/16,1
ardilgulez,so I can't give a random extent for that ,7/28/16,1
lossyrob,You_„Žll need to pull the `TileLayerMetadata[K]` from the `AttributeStore` in order to get the `MapKeyTransform` that will tell you what the extent of a tile is at a specific `z/x/y` coordinate ,7/28/16,1
lossyrob,nope,7/28/16,1
lossyrob,think of a Tile as just the col/row data,7/28/16,1

If you_„Žre writing them at different times you have to rely on the updater to fetch the intersecting tiles that have already been stored and merge them before writing.",8/2/16,1
aaron-santos,"@echeipesh  I'm interested in the updater piece. I'm having an awfully hard time ingesting large tiles using MultibandIngest. I'm subdividing them using gdal_retile but all the pieces get ingested at once and hit memory constraints. I'm wondering, can I ingest one of my smaller tiles and then fill in the rest of the of the layer's data by updating the layer iteratively using the rest of the tiles?",8/2/16,1
echeipesh,@aaron-santos You can mitigate memory problems to an extent by forcing higher partition count on input so that processing each partition doesn_„Žt blow your memory. How are you reading your inputs?,8/2/16,1
echeipesh,However at some point the input will be too large for cluster and it will fail doing this huge tiling job. You can totally use the udpater in that case. You just need to new up an updater like: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/accumulo/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/io/accumulo/AccumuloLayerUpdater.scala and call the inherited `update` function: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/io/LayerUpdater.scala#L43-L47,8/2/16,1
echeipesh,"Again there is a question what backend you_„Žre using. Accumulo updater will do the smart thing and load only the tile that potentially intersect the update and merge those before writing. Hadoop updater, at the moment, will need to load the whole layer to udpate it and write it, which makes it inappropriate for large layers (there is an issue written up how to solve that for future work).",8/2/16,1

aaron-santos,"It's sounds doable, but it might be a bit of upfront work",8/2/16,1
echeipesh,"Yes, S3 also does incremental updates. You would get your update RDDs through the same tiling process as you do currently, so they will already be `RDD[(K,V)] with Metadata[M]`, that `M` will have extent.",8/2/16,1
echeipesh,How big is your dataset in relation to your memory. Are you calling `gdal_retile` in `RDD.pipe` ?,8/2/16,1
aaron-santos,It's about half of physical ram,8/2/16,1
aaron-santos,I'm calling gdal\_retile by shelling out with `sys.process._`. The sentinel2 basetiles come in as a set of singleband rasters so the RDD is created by transforming a seq of paths to SinglebandGeoTiffs to MultibandGeotiffs that serve as the input to SparkContext.parallelize.,8/2/16,1
echeipesh,Are you passing `numSlices` to `SparkContext.paralleize` ?,8/2/16,1
echeipesh,"Half the memory of the cluster really should be small enough to process without trickery, tweaking the partition count should get you through this without having to use the updater.",8/2/16,1

aaron-santos,ohh. good to know. :),8/2/16,1
echeipesh,"@fosskers That_„Žs kind of a trick question. I assume you_„Žre asking in context of vector tiles, which store coords as offset from the tile corner rather than some CRS. However those tiles overall would have to be in SOME projection system and those tile corners would have some absolte coord.  So you would need to add those pixel offests to absolute position of the tile scaled by the pixel width/height in that CRS.",8/2/16,1
echeipesh,I would guess that almost any tile you will get your hands on will be in WebMercator. If that_„Žs the case you can use `ZoomedLayoutScheme` to get the tile layout for the zoom level you_„Žre at https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/tiling/ZoomedLayoutScheme.scala#L23 and use the tile x/y to get the extent of the tile.,8/2/16,1
fosskers,"From the spec:> A Vector Tile represents data based on a square extent within a projection. A Vector Tile SHOULD NOT contain information about its bounds and projection. The file format assumes that the decoder knows the bounds and projection of a Vector Tile before decoding it.> Web Mercator is the projection of reference, and the Google tile scheme is the tile extent convention of reference. Together, they provide a 1-to-1 relationship between a specific geographical area, at a specific level of detail, and a path such as https://example.com/17/65535/43602.mvt.> Vector Tiles MAY be used to represent data with any projection and tile extent scheme.",8/2/16,1
echeipesh,"Right, so in geotrellis terms we would need `LayoutDefinition` as an input.",8/2/16,1
fosskers,"VectorTiles have no zoom, interestingly",8/2/16,1
fosskers,"or pardon me, I suppose you could store different tiles of the same area in a pyramiding way and call that zoom layers",8/2/16,1
echeipesh,The way they are stored they do. Looking at https://www.mapbox.com/vector-tiles/ you see reference to `http://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v4/mapbox.mapbox-streets-v7/14/4823/6160.mvt?access_token=<your access token>` where 14 is zoom level and 4823 is column and 6160 is row.,8/2/16,1
echeipesh,"Yes, exactly as you say.",8/2/16,1
fosskers,"Alright, I'm digging into the relationship between projections, layout definitions, and extents",8/2/16,1
echeipesh,That sounds like a title of an excellent doc page I wish we had.,8/2/16,1
fosskers,Yeah we definitely need more docs,8/2/16,1

owcm,@lossyrob Replying back to your response on Jul15 comment and my latest post on the same issues.  I think its memory issues killing the executors as well.   You suggest mucking with partition sizes.  Where would suggest adjusting them.    I am reading in 3 datasets in from Avro and merging them to create a suitability raster.    I have played with partition sizes when ingesting files into the Avro system put have not made adjustments in other areas.  There is something on the hairy edge because 2 out of 3 times the same process will run all the way through.,8/11/16,1

ardilgulez,I think this kind of a thing works on 2 RDDs: (rdd1 union rdd2).reduceByKey(_ ++ _),8/22/16,1
pomadchin,that_„Žs correct; but that would work in case when you have keys,8/22/16,1

I_„Žm not sure if it will do the trick for you but you could try downsampling the tiles a bit and stitching them before extracting the polygon. (I_„Žm thinking you might need to downsample for the stitch, which will cause a collect, not to blow the memory on the driver)",8/22/16,1

owcm,I wanted to render the results of a RDD dataset that I stored in a FileAttributeStore using FileLayerWriter.  I used Pyramid.upLevels to build the different zoom levels.  I wanted to us a qualitative scheme and Histograms to render the data.  The endpoint I have stood up receives the the Z/X/Y value and I fetch the tile from the store using FileReader.  At this point I can use ColorMap.fromQuantileBreaks on the tile to apply my Colormap but of course the mapping and the breaks are calculated in the context of the individual tile.   The question: Is there away to consider all the values stored for the RDD when rendering the tile.   The approach I am using  is evaluating each tile in isolation not in the context of the range of values for the complete stored RDD.,8/22/16,1
echeipesh,"@owcm The thing to do is to calculate the histogram as you save your layers in `Pyramid.upLevels` and save it in the `AttributeStore`. Generally we store layer wide metadata under zoom level 0 for a layer. Also since histogram only needs to be aproximate you may calcualte it on one of the intermidiate zoom levels, not only the base level.",8/22/16,1
echeipesh,"then your tile endpoint can just query the `AttributeStore` for that histogram, cache it memory and render tiles on the fly.",8/22/16,1
owcm,"@echeipesh Thanks, I was starting to move in that direction.  Are there any examples you can point me to of writing  and reading ""layer wide metadata""  to  the attribute store?",8/22/16,1

wsf1990,I mean a tile or a geotiff to cut not query from rdd,8/23/16,1
ardilgulez,I think gdal_retile is your answer here,8/23/16,1
wsf1990,"yes, but how can I do it by gt?",8/23/16,1
ardilgulez,"from what I understand, your problem is:1- you have a geotiff whose extent is, let's say 20, 20, 30, 302- you want a geotiff whose extent is, let's say 22, 22, 28, 28",8/23/16,1

pomadchin,you can_„Žt merge tiffs; but you can merge rasters,8/24/16,1
pomadchin,"so what you need to do is to convert singlebandgeotiff into raster: ```scalatiff.raster.merge( <other raster there> )```",8/24/16,1
wsf1990,I see the source code the function of merge can just merge the raster with the same or interact extent. Which I need more like stitch,8/24/16,1
pomadchin,mmm i see,8/24/16,1
pomadchin,by design merge is a sort of a mosaic function,8/24/16,1

pomadchin,that should work,8/24/16,1
wsf1990,"yes,How can I stitch tiles?",8/24/16,1

owcm,Is that what you are talking about,9/14/16,1
lossyrob,yeah. so that `fromRdd` call is saying that the cellType is one thing. And at some point it turns out that_„Žs not true. Just a matter of figuring out how the cell type of the tiles could be different from the metadata created there,9/14/16,1
owcm,hmm,9/14/16,1
owcm,@lossyrob Yep one of my operations (calculations) was modifying the tiles type but not the metadata for the RDD.  Hard lesson learned,9/14/16,1
owcm,@lossyrob and thanks for your help,9/14/16,1
lossyrob,no problem,9/14/16,1
owcm,@lossyrob After doing a little more testing I notice one curious result.  I had a elevation RDD layer that was read from Avro.  Tile and RDD celltype was Float32.  I run a slope on the elevation RDD and the resulting slope RDD has a RDD celltype of float32 and Tile celltype values of float64. Should this be expected?,9/15/16,1
lossyrob,"no, that_„Žs a bug",9/15/16,1

lossyrob,"so the tiles are actaully telling the truth in your case, and you can_„Žt make a multiband out of the different cell types",9/15/16,1

willtemperley,Great :)  can you think of an example I could start hacking with?  I was thinking it's similar to image ingestion really,9/15/16,1
lossyrob,so funny you guys have the same avatar,9/15/16,1
lossyrob,"so there_„Žs the landsat tutorial, which only works local, but you said you got through that - what questions do you have about that or what things would you like to see next?",9/15/16,1

willtemperley,Yes I hacked that one to get it running on the cluster (at least the ingest part),9/15/16,1
willtemperley,Wasn't immediately obvious how to serve the tiles via Spark though,9/15/16,1
echeipesh,You should be able to specify the writer to actually save it to HDFS (or Accumulo if you_„Žre interested in running it),9/15/16,1
willtemperley,Yep did that,9/15/16,1
willtemperley,Or do you mean the rasterization?,9/15/16,1
echeipesh,"No no, I mean what you understood",9/15/16,1
willtemperley,"Alright thanks chaps, I'll have a play around with the landsat tutorial, and see if I can get something sensible done, borobably",9/15/16,1
willtemperley,*probably with some toy geojson examples,9/15/16,1
echeipesh,Sorry had to step away for a sec. So just to be clear you_„Žre reading OSM data somehow into Geometries and you_„Žre rasterising them into GeoTrellis tiles ?,9/15/16,1
lossyrob,"You wouldn_„Žt want to server the tiles _„ƒout of spark_„Ž though, you_„Žd want to make transformations of data, and then pull tiles out individually and do rendering/etc on the fly",9/15/16,1
willtemperley,@echeipesh my use case is best explained here: https://github.com/willtemperley/osm-hadoop,9/15/16,1
willtemperley,"What I want to do is get a dynamically updated version of OSM into HBase, replicated with Osmosis",9/15/16,1
willtemperley,Then be able to rasterize this to compare with satellite imagery (or actually forest loss products derived from landsat),9/15/16,1
lossyrob,sounds like a pretty awesome use case,9/15/16,1
lossyrob,what parts of that did you want to use geotrellis for?,9/15/16,1
willtemperley,The raster processing engine,9/15/16,1
lossyrob,"we wrap JTS in scala, and I see you_„Žre using JTS so that_„Žs an easy win if you_„Žre doing geometry stuff in scala",9/15/16,1
lossyrob,"then for rasterization, we have functionality for that",9/15/16,1
lossyrob,if you_„Žre really only looking for per-pixel values that are covered by geometries,9/15/16,1
lossyrob,not any sort of pretty graphics stuff,9/15/16,1
willtemperley,Yes - or per pixel areas not covered by geometries in fact,9/15/16,1
willtemperley,Where there's deforestation but no OSM data,9/15/16,1
lossyrob,"its pretty generic, just iterates over cells covered by geometries",9/15/16,1
lossyrob,"given a specific RasterExtent (combination of Extent, which is a bounding box type in geotrellis, and cols/rows grid definition)",9/15/16,1
willtemperley,Yes so it's all quite doable,9/15/16,1
lossyrob,"so you could initialize a tile that is all positive values, and then rasterize the vector data over that tile to set things to NODATA that are covered",9/15/16,1
willtemperley,That's one way I guess,9/15/16,1
willtemperley,So GeoTrellis gives the rasterization and the option to do Map Algebra at scale ,9/15/16,1
lossyrob,"rasterization would have to happen per-tile if you want to do it at scale, and I don_„Žt think we have that story full fleshed out. but the components are there",9/15/16,1
lossyrob,and yes we provide ways to do map algebra on RDDs of raster data,9/15/16,1
willtemperley,Using MapReduce I've rasterized the global OSM product,9/15/16,1
willtemperley,into tiles,9/15/16,1
lossyrob,nice,9/15/16,1
willtemperley,So I just sent the pixels to a tileId and then prioritized,9/15/16,1
lossyrob,in that codebase?,9/15/16,1
lossyrob,send the pixels...,9/15/16,1
willtemperley,Actually that was per-pixel ,9/15/16,1
lossyrob,"so yu rasterize each geometry, and then those are the pixels you are sending?",9/15/16,1
willtemperley,I think I took out the tiling in the final version as it wasn't necessary at that resolution,9/15/16,1
willtemperley,Yes that's right,9/15/16,1
lossyrob,gotcha,9/15/16,1
willtemperley,It was only 1km though so at 30m res that might get tricky,9/15/16,1
lossyrob,"if you pick your CRS and tile layout prior, you could match each geom to the spatial keys it covers, rasterize against each of those, and then do a big merge at the end",9/15/16,1
lossyrob,"using our TileLayout, LayoutDefinition, MapKeyTransform, SpatialKey types",9/15/16,1
willtemperley,You mean map the tile(s) for each geom then merge?,9/15/16,1
lossyrob,well let_„Žs see,9/15/16,1
lossyrob,"if we start with `RDD[Feature[Geometry, OsmData]]`",9/15/16,1
lossyrob,or some feature type,9/15/16,1
lossyrob,"we could `rdd.flatMap` those to the spatial keys (the tile ids, tile keys) that they intersect",9/15/16,1
lossyrob,and then try to group the geometries by the tile key,9/15/16,1
willtemperley,Ah - actually intersect the geometries with the tile?,9/15/16,1
lossyrob,"```scalardd.flatMap { feature =>  val keys: Seq[SpatialKey] = getCoveredKeys(feature)  keys.map { key => (key, feature) }}.groupByKey() .map { case (key, features) =>  // Now create a tile for that key that is the rasterization of all those features}```",9/15/16,1
willtemperley,"I see, so the tile would get all the geometries that it intersects with",9/15/16,1
willtemperley,That'd be an issue though with big geometries - lots of data movement and unnecessary work,9/15/16,1
lossyrob,"yeah. and then it_„Žs a matter of creating a tile and rasterizing those geoms. and at that point you have a `RDD[(SpatialKey, Tile)]`",9/15/16,1
lossyrob,"true, but you can choose to shuffle geoms or choose to shuffle tiles, tiles are the bigger ones normally",9/15/16,1
lossyrob,you can try to do a reduceByKey instead of the group,9/15/16,1
lossyrob,but yeah that would produce intermediate Tiles,9/15/16,1
willtemperley,I honestly don't know Spark well enough to judge these things,9/15/16,1
willtemperley,I think much more in MapReduce,9/15/16,1
lossyrob,it_„Žs a similiar concern though. the shuffle and trying to avoid big data shuffling around,9/15/16,1
lossyrob,what_„Žs the smaller set of data that you would shuffle than the geoms,9/15/16,1
lossyrob,?,9/15/16,1
willtemperley,"I'd think of intermediate tiles in Spark, e.g. one for each geometry in the tile",9/15/16,1
willtemperley,Pixels don't work well in Spark because there's a lot of object overhead,9/15/16,1
willtemperley,Ok in MR because there's almost none ,9/15/16,1
lossyrob,hm. how is there no object overhead for pixels in MR?,9/15/16,1
willtemperley,I could be wrong but it was my impression that reusing writables meant little object overhead,9/15/16,1
willtemperley,whereas in spark you kind of have to create an object for every value,9/15/16,1
lossyrob,wouldn_„Žt that only be from reading from disk?,9/15/16,1
lossyrob,"I_„Žm honestly not sure how MR shuffles work, or how the serialization happens",9/15/16,1
willtemperley,"I can't explain it either, especially at 11pm after a pizza :) but personally I can't get spark to peform anywhere near MR",9/15/16,1
willtemperley,At least for ETL,9/15/16,1
lossyrob,"interesting. well knowing spark pretty well, I_„Žd be happy to take a look at some of the spark code to see if I can see anything",9/15/16,1
willtemperley,"That'd be great, I'd love to know if I'm doing something wrong. ",9/15/16,1

pomadchin,"on the spot; so how everything happens: 1. you have you raw tiffs2. ingest them and tile into projections you want and tiling scheme you want (for example, zooming layout scheme, web mercator) 3. you can query whatever you wantthe basic Type we operate is Tile (basically it_„Žs a tiled tiff, array of bytes), so you can convert it into whatever you want",9/18/16,1

dorukozturk,"Ok, that makes perfect sense. What about higher zoom levels? I see on default you compute level 12. What if I wanna zoom into level 17 or 18? I need to specify the maxZoomLevel then but assuming that is going to take forever. Do you have any approach on that? ",9/18/16,1
pomadchin,mm we calculate max zoom level basing on its resolution in a UTM zone (you can read more about it [there](https://caniban.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/tile-based-geospatial-information-systems.pdf) but i dont rememeber exact page) O: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/48162b824df222afbd75c6495fa1e4bc00344fd9/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/tiling/ZoomedLayoutScheme.scala#L51 ,9/18/16,1
pomadchin,you _can_ resample to a zoom level you want on demand,9/18/16,1
pomadchin,and there would be no _siginificant_ quality loss,9/18/16,1
dorukozturk,@pomadchin I really appreciate your help. I will try to wrap my head around all of those. Thanks...,9/18/16,1
pomadchin,"yep, any questions ;) and the pseudo example of resampling on demand: ```scalaval LayoutLevel(_, layout) = layoutScheme.levelForZoom(projection.worldExtent, zoom)val mapTransform = MapKeyTransform(meta.crs, layout.layoutCols, layout.layoutRows)val targetExtent = mapTransform(x, y)val gb @ GridBounds(nx, ny, _, _) = meta.mapTransform(targetExtent)val sourceExtent = meta.mapTransform(nx, ny)val largerTile = tileReader.reader[SpaceTimeKey, Tile](layerId).read(SpaceTimeKey(nx, ny, dt))largerTile.resample(sourceExtent, RasterExtent(targetExtent, 256, 256)```",9/18/16,1

dorukozturk,"Hey everyone, I am trying to create a simple ETL application on local. When I understand the concept I will move to aws. I created the fat jar (spark-etl) with sbt assembly. Everything is great. As far as I understand now I need to create 3 json files. input.json, output.json and backend-profiles. I was reading both the docs and looking at the 2 examples : Landsat emr and chatta. https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis-chatta-demo/blob/9f58a2db2829053ccbc796e79bc9aa44832aa8b5/geotrellis/conf/backend-profiles.json My question is on this backend-profiles.json why there are both cassandra and accumulo backends defined? http://bigdata-guide.blogspot.com/2014/01/hbase-versus-cassandra-versus-accumulo.html I am still on the learning phase but as far as I understood they are pretty much doing the same thing with some variety. (Accumulo, hbase amd cassandra).  So my question is how do you decide on selecting between accumulo, hbase and cassandra and why in the chatta example 2 backends were specified?",9/25/16,1
lossyrob,"We give users an option between using a variety of backends, in case they would want to use that particular backend. As far as how to decide on one, that's a bit up to the user. In my opinion, Cassandra is easier to deploy, but we use accumulo more since other projects (geomesa, geowave) in our ecosystem use it. HDFS is a simpler choice, but on the past it has been slower than accumulo; @echeipesh has made some changes though that have made it pretty optimized. Cassandra support is newer to us; but is pretty fast and good for what we've tested for. S3 had been a great backend for us; it's significantly slower but so easy to manage.",9/25/16,1
lossyrob,"This is all you say, there's not a clear set of guidelines on what backend to use in what situation, and it's a bit of work to figure out which would be best for your situation. We would really like to figure it out with you, though. What is your use case?",9/25/16,1
dorukozturk,"I have 2 use cases. 1) We have some Landsat products (called ""Golden Tiles""), which are in hdf format. I wrote a gdal script to convert them into geotiffs. we have 2 objectives. We want to be able to show them on a Web Map and we want to be able to do arithmetic on them. Per geotiff is like 1.2 gigs with 24 bands in them and there are plenty of images. So it is classified as a ""big data"" problem. I used Earth Engine for 2-3 years and pretty good with it but naturally I am not super familiar with the underlying magic. I feel like Geotrellis will satisfy my curiosity on how distributed computations work . 2) We want to do some map algebra and tiling again on gddp data. Again our work requires tiling and we don't like to store pngs (gdal2tiles is not working for us). When I say map algebra it can be basic arithmetic. Also we might want to do some mosaicing with the Golden Tiles or create time series for an area (by taking the mean) and so on.    ",9/25/16,1
dorukozturk,The problem is all my experience is with Python and Javascript. Scala is a new world to me. Same with Spark. So it is taking some time to wrap my head around. ,9/26/16,1
lossyrob,That makes sense. ,9/26/16,1
lossyrob,"So really the choice of backends has to do with how comfortable you are with storing the amount of data you have in a specific backend, which for S3 is one thing. For accumulo is another thing - your talking terabytes of ebs or ephemeral storage (talking aws language)",9/26/16,1
lossyrob,But serving tiles from s3 is more costly than ephemeral disk on an economic instance grabbed through accumulo 's index,9/26/16,1
lossyrob,"So if you want to serve many tiles fast, and the IO cost is important to keep down, then paying for that quick indexed storage makes sense ",9/26/16,1
lossyrob,"Either way, geotrellis is set up so it is quick enough to render on the fly via a tile server ",9/26/16,1
lossyrob,"So you store raw data that you can perform you map algebra on, per tile (with many layers overlapping spatial extent, or spatial extent over time in the case of landsat)",9/26/16,1
lossyrob,"And after you perform your map algebra, with dynamic parameters usually, you paint it and then put it on a leaflet map",9/26/16,1
lossyrob,That's a usual use case anyway ,9/26/16,1
dorukozturk,Yepp,9/26/16,1
lossyrob,"If you want to do time series dynamically, you get into the world of calling spark jobs per request",9/26/16,1
lossyrob,Request,9/26/16,1
lossyrob,Which is actually not clear that spark supports very well.  But we do it.,9/26/16,1
lossyrob,"But if there's a small enough collection of tiles to analyze, it is fast.",9/26/16,1
lossyrob,"You pull back your query area and time range from you layer, and you do the analysis in an RDD. We do that dynamically, buy still working out the limitations of it.",9/26/16,1
lossyrob,As far as speed goes.  And multitenancy.,9/26/16,1
lossyrob,"Scala and spark are a hurdle, and we",9/26/16,1
dorukozturk,For now my concern is understanding GT do some basic things on local. Then launch a cluster provision it and try the stuff there.,9/26/16,1
lossyrob,Are here to help with that. ,9/26/16,1
dorukozturk,Yes you are being super helpful. It is a sunday evening and you are answering my questions :D,9/26/16,1
lossyrob,"Ok. For local, we have a File backend, which is what you should always use for the local case. Just acts like any other backend, but just reading and writing to disk",9/26/16,1
lossyrob,"You can write whole applications using local file backend, and then move it to accumulo or whatever by changing what LayerReader etc you are using ",9/26/16,1
dorukozturk,Thank you very much for the guidance.  I will let you know as there is progress.,9/26/16,1

lossyrob,is it multiband or single band?,9/28/16,1
dorukozturk,It is multiband,9/28/16,1
dorukozturk,and I added the time tag for the geotiff using gdal,9/28/16,1
lossyrob,what_„Žs the `load` call look like?,9/28/16,1
lossyrob,"`etl.load[TemporalProjectedExtent, MultibandTile](_„_)` is what it should look like",9/28/16,1

wsf1990,@dorukozturk I think you havnt change your etl.load to what  @lossyrob said.,9/29/16,1
dorukozturk,"https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/docs/spark-etl/spark-etl-intro.md on this page there is insturctions for creating a fat jar, creating 3 json files like input, output and backend-profile and running spark-submit is that not the right thing to do ?",9/29/16,1
lossyrob,"` val sourceTiles = etl.load[I, V]`",9/29/16,1

lossyrob,that `I` ad `V` type params aren_„Žt defined anywhere,9/29/16,1
lossyrob,not sure how that even compiles,9/29/16,1
wsf1990,"yes,But you must change your etl.load code",9/29/16,1
lossyrob,I_„Žll add an issue to make that more clear in the docs,9/29/16,1
lossyrob,also you have to set the `K` and the `V`,9/29/16,1

wsf1990,"`Etl.ingest[TemporalProjectedExtent, SpaceTimeKey, MultibandTile](args)`",9/29/16,1
lossyrob,ah also that,9/29/16,1
lossyrob,good point @wsf1990 ,9/29/16,1
lossyrob,I made 2 new issues for a better error message and better docs,9/29/16,1
dorukozturk,"OK, I am a little confused. It is getting late :D, so step by step is this how it should be done:1) Fix this line https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/0a377df953e502cfeb1b68cc91d625aaa9c84625/spark-etl/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/etl/Etl.scala#L422) Create the assembly3) Create input.json, output.json and backend-profiles.json4) run the spark-submit job?Or should I create something by looking at the sample etl application code? I feel like the canned multiband example will do the job for me or is that assumption wrong? Sorry guys  probably it is me not understanding.",9/29/16,1
lossyrob,That sounds right. But yeah we should have a clear example of this case,9/29/16,1
wsf1990,Not need.you just need change the code wchich called the Etl,9/29/16,1
lossyrob,ah.  yeah you don_„Žt need to modify the geotrellis code,9/29/16,1
lossyrob,"that `I,V` there is determined by the method params",9/29/16,1
wsf1990,"change to `Etl.ingest[TemporalProjectedExtent, SpaceTimeKey, MultibandTile](args)`",9/29/16,1
lossyrob,@wsf1990 do you have an example ETL app that you could share?,9/29/16,1

wsf1990,@pomadchin I have run my app to cdh successfully,9/29/16,1

pomadchin,have you tried to track down where is possible limitation happens? :0,10/1/16,1
ardilgulez,couldn't really,10/1/16,1
ardilgulez,do you guys have the code of the tile ingester for this: http://207.245.89.238/labs1-demo/index.html ?,10/1/16,1
ardilgulez,or the entire codebase and the data ,10/1/16,1
pomadchin,"@ardilgulez yo, reread your question; so it_„Žs raster pyramiding limitation / feature",10/3/16,1
pomadchin,we store zoom levels basing on the resolution in a UTM zone containing the point https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/tiling/ZoomedLayoutScheme.scala#L51,10/3/16,1
ardilgulez,Is there a way for me to get around that thing?,10/3/16,1
pomadchin,"ye, totally; you can resample tiles on demand",10/3/16,1
pomadchin,"```scalaval LayoutLevel(_, layout) = layoutScheme.levelForZoom(projection.worldExtent, zoom)val mapTransform = MapKeyTransform(meta.crs, layout.layoutCols, layout.layoutRows)val targetExtent = mapTransform(x, y)val gb @ GridBounds(nx, ny, _, _) = meta.mapTransform(targetExtent)val sourceExtent = meta.mapTransform(nx, ny)val largerTile = tileReader.reader[SpaceTimeKey, Tile](layerId).read(SpaceTimeKey(nx, ny, dt))largerTile.resample(sourceExtent, RasterExtent(targetExtent, 256, 256)```",10/3/16,1
pomadchin,or you want to persist higher zoom levels?,10/3/16,1
ardilgulez,I would like persistence,10/3/16,1
ardilgulez,And what is dt in that code,10/3/16,1
echeipesh,"@ardilgulez You_„Žre calling `rdd. kernelDensity(_„_)` on RDD of point features, right ?",10/3/16,1
pomadchin,"How do you ingest data? You see, there, in schema definition: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/tiling/ZoomedLayoutScheme.scala#L43 we have a threshold, in fact that defines max zoom level in your case, as you tiles just need to fit condition: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/tiling/ZoomedLayoutScheme.scala#L75no other ways to define max zoom level right now ): ",10/3/16,1

pomadchin,:D :D :D ,10/3/16,1
ardilgulez,"I don't use rdd.kernelDensity, I just use KernelDensity.apply",10/3/16,1
echeipesh,This: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/density/RDDKernelDensity.scala#L72 ?,10/3/16,1
ardilgulez,"nah, this: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/raster/src/main/scala/geotrellis/raster/density/KernelDensity.scala ",10/3/16,1
echeipesh,"Ok, I guess you must be doing that always with all your points, so you don_„Žt have to worry about kernel density zones around the tile edges.",10/3/16,1
echeipesh,The zoom level that is going to be ingested at is basically implied by the `rasterExtent` parameter of that function. You if double the cells/rows for the same extent is aproximately going to put it one zoom level down.,10/3/16,1
echeipesh,"Since you want to go from level 7 to level 13, that would make each tile really big, you_„Žd probably want to make the tiles smaller (Extent wise) and just cut more of them.",10/3/16,1
echeipesh,"Also, it sounds like you_„Žre saving these guys are as RDD through a LayerWriter? If so why are you trying to avoid the `RDDKernelDensity` ? It should make your life much easier here.",10/3/16,1
pomadchin,mb changing threshold is a workaround in this situation? ,10/3/16,1
echeipesh,"Well, threshold would only put it down at most one level if I understand that code correctly.",10/3/16,1
ardilgulez,"The point with threshold is, I can use it to put my stuff down up to 5 levels and my stuff can still run",10/3/16,1
ardilgulez,but down 5 levels means I still get stuck at zoom level 10,10/3/16,1
ardilgulez,which is still not really good,10/3/16,1
pomadchin,"btw, @ardilgulez @echeipesh points that you can use `rdd.kernelDensity` function",10/3/16,1
ardilgulez,does it allow me to get to higher zoom levels?,10/3/16,1
ardilgulez,"if yes, I might try that",10/3/16,1
echeipesh,@ardilgulez It should look something like this:,10/3/16,1
echeipesh,"```scalaval pointRdd: RDD[PointFeature[Int]] = ???val scheme = ZoomedLayoutScheme(WebMercator, 256)val (_, layout) = scheme.levelForZoom(13)val kernel: Kernel = ???val tileRdd: RDD[(SpatialKey, Tile)] = pointRdd.kernelDensity(kernel, layout, WebMercator)```",10/3/16,1
echeipesh,"As a warning, every time you go down a level you essentially need 4x as many bytes as the previous level, so you will see the storage used shoot way up. If there isn_„Žt that much detail in the data that you would want the resolution of zoom level 13, you would probably be better doing dynamic resampling on the tile server, or even just letting Leaflet handle (which it does if you tell it what the max zoom level of the TMS endpoint is). But you_„Žll be able to play around with it yourself of course.",10/3/16,1

metasim,"If we get the design settled out, I'll do a PR this weekend.",10/7/16,1
lossyrob,sounds good to me,10/7/16,1
metasim,@lossyrob Should `GeoTiffOptions` be a consideration?,10/8/16,1
lossyrob,"good call, though the options are not on the GeoTiffData trait",10/8/16,1
lossyrob,so you wouldn_„Žt have access to them in the TiffTagFieldValue code,10/8/16,1
lossyrob,though I_„Žm not sure why we couldn_„Žt expose it,10/8/16,1
metasim,I'm finding that by adding it to `GeoTiffData` then it cascades through constructors and factory methods in a messy way,10/8/16,1
metasim,"IOW, `GeoTiffData`to too broadly cast.",10/8/16,1
lossyrob,"Makes sense. I would say, if putting on GeoTiffOptions and exposing the options through the GeoTiffData is a lot less of an impact on the codebase, then that might be the better choice",10/8/16,1

metasim,"OK, I'll poke at that route for a bit.",10/8/16,1
metasim,Something I'm confused about: There's already a place for the value in `geotrellis.raster.io.geotiff.tags.BasicTags.photometricInterp`. Are all of these `*Tags` files for the reading side only? Is reading/writing asymmetric?,10/8/16,1

metasim,"Is there any overlap between some subset of the current GeoTrellis functionality and the [OGC Catalog Service Specification](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/cat)?

lossyrob,"We've also talked about implementing services like wms, wps, wcs etc",10/9/16,1
lossyrob,"Not sure if the best way forward for that is to implement a set of geotools interfaces and then serve through geoserver, or to write a 'geotrellis-ogc' subproject or something that would be akka-http routes that would be it's own server implementation. @dwins, who had worked closely with the geoserver project, had the opinion that the latter strategy would be best last time we talked about it",10/9/16,1
metasim,"Thanks @lossyrob . I know the GeoMesa team has WFS support (and either WCS or WMS, not sure which) by implementing the DataSource APIs to GeoServer, which may be less onerous than implementing the full spec from scratch.

lossyrob,"@metasim there_„Žs not a clear strategy for web services; we want to delineate GeoTrellis to some bounds, as not to have it be some uber umbrella project, so I_„Žm not sure having a long term strategy to web services is something that falls into the purvew of the project.

What I_„Žve done with web services is write akka http routes; but anyone else could use it however they like. If we were to build up a server with a set of capabilities, that had generic use, I_„Žm not even sure that would be _„ñgeotrellis_„, or a separate project built w/ GeoTrellis. If we were to make a DataStore in order to plug into GeoServer, then perhaps that would be part of the library. Although I wouldn_„Žt want to say _„ñyou use GeoTrellis in webservices by using GeoServer_„, because that would perhaps impose some arbitrary restriction on how you could use the library. So that_„Žs a long way to saying, we don_„Žt have a clear long term strategy for web services, I_„Žm not sure we need one, which I think falls into the _„ñminimize external dependencies and grow what_„Žs needed_„ camp although I_„Žd be happy to see projects built up to plug into existing frameworks like GeoServer and the like.",10/10/16,1
lossyrob,"As Grisha pointed out, all the *AttributeStore classes are the ones that handle the layer-level metadata for each of the layers, can list available layers, etc",10/10/16,1

I want to cut/crop out the same region of ground from both, and then perform local algebra operations against each other. Due to numerical error, the cropped tiles are of slightly different sizes, so when I try to `combine` them I get a `GeoAttrsError: Cannot combine rasters with different dimensions...`. To put it another way, I'd like to overlay the finest grid I can get away with over both scenes, sample values from each across the grid, and perform math on those samples. Is there a recommended approach to do this?",10/10/16,1
lossyrob,"You could reproject them (or one of them) so that the CRS_„Žs match, resample them to the same grid, mask w/ the region, then perform the combine",10/10/16,1

mendoza7,"Hey, I'm interested in knowing more on how GeoTrellis works with metadata, is there any documentation on that?",10/12/16,1
metasim,What kind of metadata?,10/12/16,1
metasim,GeoTiff?,10/12/16,1
mendoza7,Specifically with RDDs,10/12/16,1
metasim,I know there's this: `TileLayerMetadata.fromRdd`,10/12/16,1
mendoza7,"Oh yes, I have looked at that, how do you manage to write that metadata to hadoop or other backends? Or it depends more on hdfs api than GeoTrellis itself. I'm just having trouble visualizing how you associate that metadata throughout the process(ingest,operations,etc). ",10/12/16,1
pomadchin,"@mendoza7 yo; every backend has an `AttributeStore` class (exmpl. for accumulo: `AccumuloAttributeStore`); in fact there are two tables / dirs: one contains tiles (index, bytearray), the other one contains _per layer _ metadata",10/12/16,1
pomadchin,you can have a look into any our `LayerWriter` to see it,10/12/16,1
mendoza7,"oh ok I see, thanks! ",10/12/16,1

lossyrob,@owcm can you put the geojson and parsing code into a Gist so I can run it and debug?,10/17/16,1
owcm,"@lossyrob Sure Gist is @ https://gist.github.com/owcm/ac9421ed390c73ec0b5b6847649f5304I think the issue might be that this geojson has a z value in addition to x,y coordinates.  My other files did not have the z value.  Just a hunch.   Trying to lose the z value to validate my hunch",10/17/16,1
owcm,@lossyrob ogrinfo indicates file contains Geometry: 3D Line String. So that might be the issue.,10/17/16,1

lossyrob,or `cellType.withNoData(..)`,10/17/16,1
metasim,Exactly,10/17/16,1
metasim,If it already has `NoData` it would be a noop.,10/17/16,1

lossyrob,yeah filing an Issue would be good,10/17/16,1
lossyrob,"what happens when you have a raster that has for instance NODATA (Int.MinValue) in the raster, and you convert it to another type of nodata?",10/17/16,1
metasim,It would make sense for that to be a full copy conversion.,10/17/16,1
lossyrob,"convert might be different then the thing which doesn_„Žt edit the raster at all, which would be to change the interpretation of the values",10/17/16,1
lossyrob,"or maybe the interpretation is just for things that don_„Žt currently have a NoData value, and you_„Žre setting it for the first time",10/17/16,1
metasim,Here's my forinstance: Landsat images have an implicit `NO_DATA` value of zero. I want to enable it.,10/17/16,1

lossyrob,definitely,10/17/16,1
lossyrob,@owcm it does seem like the z coord is the problem,10/17/16,1
owcm,"Okay, something that should be reported as a bug then.  Were you expecting it to be something supported under the current implementation.",10/17/16,1
lossyrob,"yeah, I would expect to be able to at least read it without the Z values",10/17/16,1
lossyrob,"I think we hit against this at some point, and I thought we had gotten around it.. @moradology do you remember hitting up against this issue?",10/17/16,1
owcm,"Yea, that would be acceptable to me.",10/17/16,1

lossyrob,I would recommend doing a heavy clean of the binaries and rebuild,10/19/16,1
wsf1990,@pomadchin  @fosskers  @lossyrob I have resolved this.It's caused by akka version.when you use cdh and spark2.0.0-beta you must change the akka version to 2.3.14(<2.4).,10/20/16,1
wsf1990,jdk is 1.8,10/20/16,1

metasim,"@lossyrob Thanks for the response on the array allocation issue. I'll take a look at the implementation, but one concern I'd have about reusing the array is around mutability semantics: If your lambda receives an array, is it yours to do whatever you want with, or might it be changed from underneath you? If a `Seq` is passed in, you're guaranteeing immutabiliy, wity an array, it's less clear what the promises are (and allocating an array per cell as it does now is the safest approach).",10/26/16,1
lossyrob,"The Array is mutable, but also you_„Žre getting it from right before the lambda call. And the lambda could edit the array, but it gets reset on the next call. so if you_„Žre looking for immutability gauantees, that won_„Žt give it to you (besides practically). But this is a good example of pureness vs performance where I would side with the latter",10/26/16,1

lossyrob,"it almost feels like _„ñbackend_„ is something that you should be able to specify full, or specify a name which fills out potentially all of the things, or the backend definition only fills out part (e.g. credentials) and you have to supply the rest",10/31/16,1
lossyrob,but it_„Žs also weird to me that input and output _„ñbackends_„ get treated the same. I usually think of supported backends as only the things we write to,10/31/16,1

lossyrob,"when you say _„ñnot readable_„, where is it not readable from?",11/1/16,1
lossyrob,"that should write a valid geotiff, with the values given",11/1/16,1
lossyrob,"you_„Žre writing double values out, so it_„Žs unclear how they would be representative of colors if you want a photometric interpretation...",11/1/16,1
lossyrob,"we currently have a way to read color maps in, but don_„Žt write them out",11/1/16,1
lossyrob,"@pomadchin @echeipesh this feels hacky, but also in the context of what we have is really useful: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/pull/1764",11/1/16,1
lossyrob,thoughts?,11/1/16,1
echeipesh,Mostly I am concerned about layerWriter being exposed there,11/1/16,1
echeipesh,"What about: ` type PostSaveHook[K, V, M] = (AttributeStore,  LayerId, RDD[(K, V)] with Metadata[M]) => RDD[(K, V)] with Metadata[M]` ?",11/1/16,1
lossyrob,well,11/1/16,1
lossyrob,i figured there might be a situation where someone would want to do something to the input and save it off,11/1/16,1
lossyrob,"for instance, if we wanted to save an ndvi layer on incoming imagery",11/1/16,1
lossyrob,they could just write it off the processing of the raw layer,11/1/16,1
echeipesh,Fair _„_ then about about:,11/1/16,1
echeipesh,"```scaladef DEFAULT[K, V, M] = {      (_: AttributeStore, w: Writer[LayerId, RDD[(K, V)] with Metadata[M]], id: LayerId, rdd: RDD[(K, V)] with Metadata[M]) => w.write(id, rdd) }```",11/1/16,1
echeipesh,^ Basically have the default just write the layer. So if somebody overwrites the save hook they have to write the layer as well as whatever else they choose to do.,11/1/16,1
lossyrob,not really a post save hook then,11/1/16,1
lossyrob,but I see waht your saying,11/1/16,1
lossyrob,is that just to prevent people from thinking they have to write the layer themselves,11/1/16,1
echeipesh,"right, it_„Žd be more of a `WriterHook`",11/1/16,1
echeipesh,"Basically, its to prevent magic action when it seems like there is an explicit action.",11/1/16,1
lossyrob,yeah i buy that,11/1/16,1
echeipesh,"That also makes it more flexible, if there is some final transfomation that has to be made, it could be made here.",11/1/16,1
lossyrob,`SaveAction` as the type alias?,11/1/16,1
echeipesh,`FinalAction` ?,11/1/16,1
lossyrob,hm. I like SaveAction more,11/1/16,1
lossyrob,"because the method is called `save`",11/1/16,1
echeipesh,"Oh yeah, that makes total sense",11/1/16,1
lossyrob,alright. will ping when updated,11/1/16,1
lossyrob,makes `SpatialRenderOutput` seem even more hacky,11/1/16,1
echeipesh,"Well, if it makes a hack seem more hacky that just means its a good change ;)",11/1/16,1
lossyrob,lol. truth.,11/1/16,1
echeipesh,"@fosskers Feel like I_„Žm just littering that issue, what do you mean about target cell types being set ?",11/1/16,1
echeipesh,this issue: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/pull/1760#issuecomment-257629977,11/1/16,1
lossyrob,ah. well it looks like you are just delegating to map,11/1/16,1
lossyrob,so yeah that could totally be an apply,11/1/16,1
lossyrob,thought what happens if it needs double values?,11/1/16,1
lossyrob,"I guess there would be overloads with `BreakMap[Double, _]` for that?",11/1/16,1
echeipesh,Hmm either _„ñuser beware_„ or we can encode `  def dualMap(f: Int => Int)(g: Double => Double): Tile` as a type,11/1/16,1
echeipesh,I don_„Žt think you can rely on overloads to act sane here,11/1/16,1
lossyrob,"right. well they will act sane if they remain as overloads of `map` (dropping the apply thing)",11/1/16,1
echeipesh,What do you mean? `Tile.map` will always give `Int`s?,11/1/16,1
echeipesh,"or do you mean overload on `BreakMap` like `def mapWith(bm: BreakMap[Int, Int]): Tile` ?",11/1/16,1
lossyrob,"```scaladef map(m: BreakMap[Int, Int], targetCellType: CellType): Tile = ???def map(m: BreakMap[Int, Double], targetCellType: CellType): Tile = ???def map(m: BreakMap[Double, Int], targetCellType: CellType): Tile = ???def map(m: BreakMap[Double, Double], targetCellType: CellType): Tile = ???```",11/1/16,1
echeipesh,That_„Žll probably work,11/1/16,1
lossyrob,updated https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/pull/1764,11/1/16,1
echeipesh,"heh, see what you mean about `SpatialRenderOutput`",11/1/16,1
echeipesh,really `SpatialRenderOutput` is actually just an instance of `SaveAction` that doesnt use the writer,11/1/16,1
echeipesh,@lossyrob do you think that would be more or less hacky if there was a `RenderLayerWriter` that did the rendering on `LayerWriter._write` ?,11/1/16,1
echeipesh,All the Avro type classes would be pointless,11/1/16,1
lossyrob,yeah,11/1/16,1
lossyrob,it_„Žs another writer hierarchy,11/1/16,1
lossyrob,LayerWriter is really an AvroLayerWriter,11/1/16,1
echeipesh,Seems like it,11/1/16,1
lossyrob,was talking with someone about how it would actually be cool to serialize multiban tiles such that you could do geotiff-like byte requests to pull individual bands,11/1/16,1
lossyrob,"so you could have 11 bands saved in the layer, but only grab 2 if you wanted to do e.g. NDVI",11/1/16,1
echeipesh,So basically there might be some milage in having a broader writer/reader hiarchy,11/1/16,1
lossyrob,:+1: ,11/1/16,1
echeipesh,"Which means that `AvroRecordCodec` at least is out, other things we can probably leave. Lets say that conversation is 1.1 or something",11/1/16,1
echeipesh,"So on unrelated topic: `tile1.combine(tile2, IntCellType) { (v1, v2) => v1 + v2 }` does not smell nice to me but it seems the only _„ñcheap_„ option to determine the target cell type.",11/1/16,1
echeipesh,"The nicest alternative seems to be building off:```scalaclass LazyTile(base: => Tile) extends CellGrid    with IterableTile    with MappableTile[Tile]    with LazyLogging{  lazy val tile: Tile = base_„_}```",11/1/16,1
lossyrob,I think that combine seems fine,11/1/16,1
lossyrob,doesn_„Žt smell that bad to me,11/1/16,1
lossyrob,"other quick change of topic: I_„Žm changing AttributeStore.layerExists to read specifically the metadata attribute to check for existance. This always bothered me_„_if you wrote say the histogram of zoom 6 in zoom level 0 for a stack of layers, then when it went to go write zoom 0 it would throw saying the layer already existed",11/1/16,1
echeipesh,That seems fine. I think it might have done that at one point,11/1/16,1
lossyrob,@pomadchin what_„Žs going on with this for hbase (OS X),11/2/16,1
lossyrob,"```bash/proj/gt/geotrellis scripts/hbaseTestDB.sh latest: Pulling from daunnc/geodocker-hbase-standaloneDigest: sha256:4b056deafc366ccf449ba956bd5d1a64cd8b5aeb6ffcacaf3727c4020c8776c5Status: Image is up to date for daunnc/geodocker-hbase-standalone:latestRequires additional setup in case of Windows / OS X, known limitations: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/networking/Starting HBase containerContainer has ID a1aeec250578f04f369b3b684cad4635118c4c4cf8d8636f380fdf1245d94c5eUpdating /etc/hosts to make hbase-docker point to 172.17.0.2 (localhost)sed: -e expression #1, char 1: unknown command: `.'```",11/2/16,1

pomadchin,"*a sort of 'host security', similar to what spark has for workers",11/2/16,1

pomadchin,eh; yes,11/2/16,1
pomadchin,so hbase is quite sensitive to hosts setings (of client machine and of remote machines),11/2/16,1
pomadchin,"the problem using docker beta in that we need to connect to hbase through VM; host _„î> VM _„î> Docker in theory we need to forward all ports into VM and docker for mac logic forwards them into host (I am tolktin about exposing ports)But it causes collisions in hostnames, and yes we have access to zookeeper, but zookeeper manager names; and these names not correspond to ip neccesary addresses",11/2/16,1
pomadchin,the simple workaround is to start container with `_„înet=host` flag and to ooperate with VM the way we connect to common remote hbase,11/2/16,1

kevinmhinson,"Thanks for the feedback @lossyrob .  I'm trying to build rasters that show ""best server"" in a network.  I can convert names to some Long value as a code, but it'd be better if I could embed actual names.",11/4/16,1
lossyrob,"Interesting. You could make a _„ñtile_„ type that didn_„Žt fit into the heirarchy, but was backed by a array of strings and could be accessed by col, row",11/4/16,1
lossyrob,and then use our `TileFeature` type to compose that with a primitive type tile if you needed our operations,11/4/16,1
lossyrob,what sort of computations were you looking to do on it?,11/4/16,1
kevinmhinson,"I hate showing how remedial I am here  :worried:   at the outset just display...  next step would focal operations like mode and some measure of entropy...  starting use case would be something easy that just gets data into some GIS format...  I have a test process that looks like...  Array[Array[String]] -> Array[IntArrayTile] -> ArrayMultibandTile -> MiltibandGeoTiff.toByteArray -> SaveToS3...  but I have 250k possible servers, so Strings would be better than numeric codes.",11/4/16,1
kevinmhinson,"I know tiffs won't take Strings either, so maybe the whole GIS world is telling me something.",11/4/16,1
lossyrob,"ah interesting. sorry had to step away, but that seems like a pretty cool use case. Unfortunately you_„Žd have to use numeric codes_„_Int_„Žs would handle all the server possibilities. If you had a `Map[Int, String]`, you could pretty easily translate the codes",11/4/16,1
metasim,"In `MultibandGeoTiff` there's an implicit conversion to `MultibandTile`. It's caused me a bit of (minor) confusion, because it makes it look like methods such as `convert` exist on `MultiBandGeoTiff`, but with information loosing sematics (it drops the band tags and options). I certainly don't know the full history, but a naive analysis makes me think it's a bad implicit to have automatically pulled into scope along with `MultibandGeoTiff`. Thoughts? ",11/7/16,1

pomadchin,"the same _„ñproblem_„ we have with `RDD[(K, V)] with Metadata[M]`: on some operations we loose type information (for example after applying `map`, `with Metadata[M]` is loosed), for this purposes we have a specaial `.withContext` method, to keep rdd metadata",11/7/16,1
metasim,"The implicit makes it look like `convert` exists on `MultibandGeoTiff`, when it really doesn't. It's more of a `convertAndThrowAwayMetadata`.",11/7/16,1

lossyrob,"if they are, then we_„Žre reading the wrong amount of data in, which would account for the bad values",11/11/16,1

lossyrob,"it_„Žs true that if they are unsigned short values, the `.toShort` will ruin them",11/11/16,1
metasim,Thanks (was just looking at that in the Adobe spec). That must mean `gdalinfo` is just conveying an alpha value that doesn't exist.,11/11/16,1
metasim,"It looks like if I replace `.toShort` with a call to `def shift(c: Int) = ((c >> 8) & 0xff).toShort` it gets the right result. However, I don't know why the shift would be necessary... perhaps there's an off-by-one error in the code that constructs the `shorts` data array?",11/11/16,1
lossyrob,"perhaps, but I would think that would affect more things and be caught. but potentially",11/11/16,1
lossyrob,is it not evaluating the endian-ness correctly?,11/11/16,1
metasim,that's a possibility. I'm going to check to see  if the first 8 bits are always 0xff.... that would point to an alpha value actually being there.,11/11/16,1
metasim,"The spec doesn't speak to the short packing being ""RRRRGGGGBBBB"" etc, but that's how it appears to be layed out.",11/11/16,1
lossyrob,"well I think it reads it like that, but then holds it as Ints because we can_„Žt support unsigned shorts",11/11/16,1

lossyrob,well hm,11/11/16,1
lossyrob,"that they are actually encoded as RGBA, like RRRAGGGABBBA or ARRRAGGGABBB?",11/11/16,1
metasim,righgt. maybe gdal is corretly reading an alpha.,11/11/16,1
lossyrob,hm.,11/11/16,1
lossyrob,A dive into the gdal code would show that. which is fun code to swim through :),11/11/16,1
metasim,that doesn't make sense,11/11/16,1
metasim,might do that.,11/11/16,1
lossyrob,"if GDAL is doing that, I wonder how it knows how to do that instead of what the spec says",11/11/16,1
metasim,Oh wierd.... it turns out that `short(i) & 0xff` and `(short(i) >> 8) & 0xff` return the same value! It's like the color value is in there twice.,11/11/16,1
metasim,I'll work on it this weekend.,11/11/16,1
lossyrob,"well to get th short out, you would need `0xFFFF`",11/11/16,1
lossyrob,might be coincidence for the color to have the same on both bytes. Is it a grayscale color map?,11/11/16,1
lossyrob,"also this should be of interest to you, comes from a discussion we had: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/pull/1797",11/11/16,1
lossyrob,"not only from that, been a problem for a long while, but you reminded us that it needed to get done before 1.0",11/11/16,1
metasim,Definitely interested in #1797.... every apropos to what I've been doing recently (having to be careful with converting to `FloatXXXType` before doing any math).,11/12/16,1
metasim,"Regarding the color map, the test file is `geotrellis/raster-test/data/geotiff-test-files/colormap.tif` which is pretty standard multi-color palette. It seems suspicious that, when treated as an RGBA value, both byte 1 and byte 2 have the same value. For instance, in the test file, index 12, red value, is integer `53713`, where the following is true:```scala> (     |   53713 >> 24 & 0xFF,     |   53713 >> 16 & 0xFF,     |   53713 >> 8 & 0xFF,     |   53713 & 0xFF)res1: (Int, Int, Int, Int) = (0,0,209,209)```",11/12/16,1
metasim,"Changing the mask to `0xFFFF` (as is necessary), results in this:```scala> (     |   53713 >> 24 & 0xFFFF,     |   53713 >> 16 & 0xFFFF,     |   53713 >> 8 & 0xFFFF,     |   53713 & 0xFFFF     | )res2: (Int, Int, Int, Int) = (0,0,209,53713)```",11/12/16,1
metasim,"And as shown above, the `gdalinfo` value is `209`.",11/12/16,1
lossyrob,"I wish I could tell you how colormap.tif was created, but I_„Žm not sure",11/12/16,1
lossyrob,its possible that it_„Žs not correctly written,11/12/16,1
metasim,"I found a tool called `tiffinfo` and it reports index 12 as being `12: 53713, 56797, 63993`, which matches what I'm seeing in the code, pointing to the file as an issue (?). So I'm going to try to create a new indexed tiff file and see what I get.",11/12/16,1
metasim,"Aha, I think I know the problem!",11/12/16,1
metasim,It's not a bug really.... it's that TIFF color maps have more resolution than an RGBA packed Int!,11/12/16,1
lossyrob,"ah, because they are actually 6 bytes wide for RGB?",11/12/16,1
metasim,"I think this is what's happening.... check me. When you discretize a 24 bit RGB packed int into three 16 bit uint values ranging from 0 to 65535, the steps look like you're repeating the same byte twice.",11/12/16,1
metasim,Yes!,11/12/16,1
lossyrob,that makes sense,11/12/16,1
lossyrob,how do we deal with that?,11/12/16,1
metasim,I was planning on using the `ColorMap` classes to store the read values.,11/12/16,1
metasim,"Technically, it seems that `gdalinfo` is assuming 1 byte color channel values..... throwing things off.",11/12/16,1
metasim,I'm in the midding of digging through the gdal code but haven't quite found the place where `gdalinfo` might read the 16 bit color channel and report it.,11/12/16,1
metasim,"So, in short, it all depends on how much resolution we care about in allowing a geotrellis user to express via color maps.",11/12/16,1
lossyrob,"interesting. so another _„ñTIFF says something, but in practice GDAL does it a slightly different way_„ moment",11/12/16,1
metasim,So this isn't an anomaly then? :/,11/12/16,1
lossyrob,"hm, I_„Žm not sure. how can we support 24 bit RGB outside of just the color map? we always assume RGBA packed ints",11/12/16,1
lossyrob,but perhaps someone would want to write them out that way,11/12/16,1
metasim,"I really wanted to use the existing `ColorMap` structures....I had implemented this:```class IndexedColorMap(indexedColors: Seq[Int]) extends IntColorMap(  indexedColors.zipWithIndex.map(p __ p._2 -> p._1).toMap)```",11/12/16,1
metasim,But now I'm thinking one might need something like a `LongColorMap`?,11/12/16,1
metasim,(to pack three 2 byte color channels into a single type),11/12/16,1
lossyrob,that make sense with the depth,11/12/16,1
metasim,Might end up with something that breaks compatibility with everything else.,11/12/16,1
lossyrob,yeah. we don_„Žt handle Longs at all,11/12/16,1
lossyrob,"was always thinking of a Tile with a Long type, but that breaks our Int/Double interface",11/12/16,1
lossyrob,maybe something to think about for 2.0,11/12/16,1
metasim,"For the purpose that indexed colors serve, it seems silly that they use a short per channel.",11/12/16,1
lossyrob,is there something that isn_„Žt in the ColorMap heirarchy that would solve this problem?,11/12/16,1
lossyrob,right. we could also go the gdal route and assume bytes,11/12/16,1
lossyrob,if that is in fact what GDAL does,11/12/16,1
metasim,"The `Tile`s aren't the issue.... just the `ColorMap`, but I'd argue we just flatten into single byte channels.",11/12/16,1
metasim,I'll try to confirm the GDAL approach.,11/12/16,1
lossyrob,:+1:,11/12/16,1
metasim,"One doesn't technically have to use the `ColorMap` classes... just stick with `(Short, Short, Short)`, but cross compatibility with the PNG/JPG writers would be nice.",11/12/16,1

david-2012,"Hi, @lossyrob . I am new to geotrellis. And I am trying to use geotrellis and spark to build ",11/18/16,1
david-2012,"a server which can provide a tms service.  Currently it worked if I used geotrellis-spark etl object to build a pyramid of tilelayerRDD via etl.load, etl.tile  functions from the tiff files. Is there any approach for building a pyramid from the tilelayerRDD(maybe this tilelayerRDD is transformed from other operations, whatever..), without saving this tilelayerRDD in the file system and reload it again. Appreciated very much!",11/18/16,1
lossyrob,"Hi @david-2012 you can. ETL is just some convienience wrapping around some functionality, so you could unfurl that functionality and use the inner parts manually (e.g. https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/pyramid/Pyramid.scala)",11/18/16,1
lossyrob,or you could use the saveAction param on Etl.save to avoid saving,11/18/16,1
lossyrob,"I think I would need to know what you_„Žd like to do with the pyramid (which in effect is a `Map[Int, TileLayerRDD[K]]`) without saving it to be able to suggest further",11/18/16,1
lossyrob,GeoDocker question @pomadchin if your around - got clues about why a container that is based on geodocker-spark would not put any console output when running a spark-submit? It_„Žs almost as if the logger properties aren_„Žt being recognized from the parent geodocker-spark container in the child container,11/18/16,1
lossyrob,also should we have a geodocker gitter?,11/18/16,1
tkunicki,"haha, was just wondering if I should ask my GeoDocker Qs here",11/18/16,1
lossyrob,"lol. yeah this is the place so far, but I think it would be good to have a separate channel",11/18/16,1
lossyrob,"I_„Žll make one now, but feel free to ask any q_„Žs here",11/18/16,1
lossyrob,"gitter is not being awesome about letting me make a channel, erroring without a message, so Ill have to figure out what_„Žs going on with that",11/18/16,1
lossyrob,@tkunicki https://gitter.im/geodocker/geodocker,11/18/16,1
david-2012,"@lossyrob , thanks for your kindly replies. What I'd like to do is to display  directly the result of some arithmetic operation on the TileLayerRDD objects,which represents the geotiff data via the leaflet directly using pyramid mode, without saving the result on accumulo or HDFS.Currently, there are two issues for me:1. The TileLayerRDD holds an extend for the whole raster in its metadata, however, before building the pyramid, I need get the projectExtend for each tile to call its function tileToLayout. Do you have any suggestions on how to obtain each tile projectExtend from the whole raster extend.2. Using the etl.load, we can get the suitable SpatialKey index range for building pyramid with specific zoom Index. Without etl.load, how can I transform the TileLayerRDD SpatialKey index  range for this purpose.Thanks agian for your answers.",11/21/16,1
pomadchin,hi @david-2012 ,11/21/16,1
david-2012,yes,11/21/16,1
david-2012,@pomadchin  yes ?,11/21/16,1
pomadchin,"Ok, so the steps would be the following: 1. read everything as (ProjectedExtent, Tile) pairs2. retile them into (SpatialKey, Tile)3. build the pyramid",11/21/16,1
pomadchin,sec I_„Žll prepare you a codesample,11/21/16,1
david-2012,"@pomadchin , thanks a lot!",11/21/16,1
pomadchin,@david-2012 there is an code sample:  https://gist.github.com/pomadchin/f8fe77f24e84a862fe92c4d6e4147c96,11/21/16,1
pomadchin,another working example can be found in our Landsat EMR demo: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis-landsat-emr-demo/blob/master/ingest/src/main/scala/demo/LandsatIngest.scala#L23-L59,11/21/16,1
pomadchin,"And the most unpopular variant is to use Ingest object: https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/ingest/Ingest.scalaUsage example: ```scalaval source: RDD[ProjectedExtent, Tile] = ???val destCrs: CRS = ???val layoutScheme: LayoutScheme = ???Ingest[ProjectedExtent, SpatialKey](source, destCrs, layoutScheme) { (rdd, zoom) =>  // your logic here, persist or smth else}```",11/21/16,1
pomadchin,O: any questions about these codelines are appreciated :D ,11/21/16,1
david-2012,"thanks, very appreciated. That's all I want.  By the way,  I transform the TileLayerRDD to MapHadoopRDD by map the SpatialKey to ProjectedExtent for each tile so that the pyramid can be built from the tileLayerRDD directly.   And it finally worked.",11/21/16,1
pomadchin,glad it worked for you :D,11/21/16,1
pomadchin,there is a single function to convert your rdd to tiled rdd: `tileToLayout`,11/21/16,1

david-2012,Very appreciated!,11/21/16,1
lossyrob,@pomadchin are you at the point where you_„Žve loaded up an RDD of point cloud data with the input formats (even locally)?,11/21/16,1
pomadchin,"yo! yep, not very well checked but i can load everything as `path -> PackePoints` rdd pairs",11/21/16,1
pomadchin,"there are {max,min}{x,y,z} data in files metadata, that means that would be not too hard to create a ProjectedExtent key",11/21/16,1

pomadchin,@lossyrob if you have any comments that would be cool if you_„Žll throw them to me; as there can be lots of interesting design / math / etc things,11/21/16,1
lossyrob,"well if we can get Las files in any form into an RDD, then we are cooking with gas",11/21/16,1
lossyrob,The next thing would be to break them out by spatialkeys,11/21/16,1
lossyrob,over some specific tile layout,11/21/16,1
lossyrob,I wonder if there would be some streaming way to create the DEM as we are deciding what spatial keys the points belong to,11/21/16,1
lossyrob,@jamesmcclain know what I mean?,11/21/16,1
lossyrob,is there a streaming tinning algorithm that we could apply here?,11/21/16,1
lossyrob,I guess because we_„Žre using the JTS triangulation we_„Žre stuck with it_„Žs method of doing it,11/21/16,1
jamesmcclain,I am not sure what you mean,11/21/16,1
jamesmcclain,"It depends on what you mean by ""as we are deciding what spatial keys""",11/21/16,1
lossyrob,"so, we have basically an `RDD[(Extent, PiontCloud)]`",11/21/16,1
lossyrob,"in order to turn those into `RDD[(SpatialKey, PointCloud)]`, we have to locate each point in a SpatialKey",11/21/16,1
jamesmcclain,I guess what I am getting at is: we cannot do a triangulation over the entire set of points,11/21/16,1
lossyrob,"Can we do parital triangulations, and then merge them",11/21/16,1
jamesmcclain,So it is necessary to have some rough idea of where the keys are with respect to groupings of points,11/21/16,1
lossyrob,"so do a (SpatialKey, Mesh)] on each element, and then merge those elements in a reduceByKey",11/21/16,1
jamesmcclain,So that triangulations can be done on subsets of the points,11/21/16,1
jamesmcclain,"It is technically possible, to merge triangulations, but it is not a good idea",11/21/16,1
lossyrob,why not?,11/21/16,1
jamesmcclain,Because it introduces the complexity of fixing up the triangulations at the seams between areas,11/21/16,1
lossyrob,"ok. that was the question, if there was a nice _„ƒstreaming_„Ž way to do it, where you could add points dynamically",11/21/16,1
jamesmcclain,"That fixup process is entirely possible, but it is no less complicated (from the standpoint of the person writing the code) than doing an entire triangulation",11/21/16,1
lossyrob,what about the standpoint of CPU time,11/21/16,1
jamesmcclain,Well the problem is that it is difficult to get right,11/21/16,1
jamesmcclain,The same robustness issues that we ran into before with the Delaunay triangulator would show up again,11/21/16,1
jamesmcclain,"That is, unless the overall triangulation does not have to be Delaunay (but that would cause problems with the interpolation algorithm)",11/21/16,1
lossyrob,dang. alright,11/21/16,1
lossyrob,might be a future improvement/optimization,11/21/16,1
jamesmcclain,"I mean there are things you can do, but the kinds of things that I can think of right now would be fairly ad hoc",11/21/16,1
lossyrob,"rather then iterating through the points once to place them, and then iterating through them again to triangulate ",11/21/16,1
jamesmcclain,"For example, you can do Delauney over a collection of points, then to merge adjacent collections of points, you throw away part of the triangulation that you already have and use the existing triangulator over some overlapping portion",11/21/16,1
jamesmcclain,But that does not seem to be preferable to just triangulating the entire thing once you have it,11/21/16,1
lossyrob,makes sense,11/21/16,1
jamesmcclain,"I just did a little bit of googling, and there definitely are divide and conquer Delaunay algorithms.  If we could find robust predicates for Java/Scala they would probably be usable",11/21/16,1
jamesmcclain,"Actually, I missed part of what you wrote before.  When you talk about not wanting to iterate through the points twice, there is the possibility of using an incremental algorithm like bowyer-watson.  The problem with that is 1) the robustness of predicates and 2) this algorithim (like all Delaunay triangulation algorithms) requires more than linear time, so it might not be exactly what you are looking for",11/21/16,1
lossyrob,perhaps. it was a thought_„_maybe something to chew on a bit more down the road,11/21/16,1
echeipesh,"A little late the conversation, but likely there is no way to generate the DEM as we_„Žre tiling. The clever approach in tin2dem  DEM streaming algorithms relies on knowing when they have seen the final point for an area, which presupposes iterating over ther points at least once (in reality 3 passes are required).",11/22/16,1
echeipesh,I would guess that pratically just  tiling out the point cloud to a tile layout is within itself very useful because it would enable bunch of parallel processing by removing _„ñhave I seen all the data_„ question.,11/22/16,1
echeipesh,PSA: Spark 2.0 no longer depends on akka-actor. They have re-implemented their RPC using netty. So any applications that have depended on `spark-core` to bring in the akka dependency will have to do it explicitly as of RC1.,11/22/16,1
willtemperley,"Hi, I've got a quick question about proj4j.  I've been looking into the history of it all and I'm wondering what the current plans are?",11/22/16,1

lossyrob,"That_„Žs still the current plan. However it_„Žs been held up by a couple of things: dwins moved on to another job, GeoTrellis is still trying to get itself through the LocatioTech move process, and so no one has been able to move it forward",11/22/16,1
lossyrob,"Also, there was immediate discussions on a rename of it from the Eclipse side, which I_„Žm opposed to",11/22/16,1

willtemperley,"Right, I see, thanks.  Where's the discussion re. the name change?",11/22/16,1
lossyrob,let me see if I can find it. Hopefully was on a public list,11/22/16,1
lossyrob,"Actually looking back through my emails, it looks like the legal team approved the name for use",11/22/16,1

willtemperley,osgeo,11/22/16,1
lossyrob,No it would be a project that was in both,11/22/16,1
lossyrob,was the hope,11/22/16,1
lossyrob,A joint OSGeo/LocationTech project would be great IMO,11/22/16,1

lossyrob,yeah,11/22/16,1
lossyrob,well and the repo would be in the location tech github,11/22/16,1

lossyrob,so we need to put together an initial contribution,11/22/16,1
lossyrob,which is the proj4j codebase that is separated out from GeoTrellis,11/22/16,1
lossyrob,I didn_„Žt see how complete dwins_„Žs repo is of that,11/22/16,1
willtemperley,There is only one or maybe two commits,11/22/16,1
lossyrob,"getting to the point where it_„Žs a good intitial contrib, which could include the maven switch, would be the first step",11/22/16,1
lossyrob,"we then submit that in what_„Žs called a _„ñCQ_„, which then the legal team will mull over and check for any IP issues",11/22/16,1

willtemperley,yes two or three basic deps IIRC,11/22/16,1
lossyrob,"also I submitted a CQ for proj4j for GeoTrellis, which got approved, so I think the process will be pretty light",11/22/16,1
lossyrob,"If you want to fork dwins_„Žs repo and get it into a good place, where it would be ready for that initial contribution CQ, that would be a good first step",11/22/16,1
willtemperley,"I can do that, would the code in the current GeoTrellis release be much changed?",11/22/16,1
willtemperley,It looks like dwins' repo was extracted on the 18th of May so probably not too far behind,11/22/16,1
lossyrob,I don_„Žt think we changed much in the java code,11/22/16,1

lossyrob,"before that, the last commit was March",11/22/16,1
lossyrob,on main at least,11/22/16,1
lossyrob,also to consider is that we wrote all the tests in scala,11/22/16,1

willtemperley,Or I don't,11/22/16,1
lossyrob,Yeah I would be fine with that,11/22/16,1

david-2012,"Hi, @pomadchin I use the following function to build up a pyramid from TileLayerRDD. And it worked for some TileLayerRDD. For example, if rsterRDD is a tilelayerRDD read from Accumulo, the following function could build a correct pyramid list.  rster = reader.read[SpatialKey, Tile,      TileLayerMetadata[SpatialKey]](LayerId(layerId, 0)).convert(DoubleConstantNoDataCellType)However, if the rsterRDD  came from the a few stages of transformation and actions in the Spark, most of tiles in the pyramid list built by the following function are invalid, i.e. ND. such as rster = new ContextRDD(result, metaData)And I compared both types of TileLayerRDD, 1. the partition length of the former is 1, and the later length is 10, depended on my spark conf setting.   Besides, I repartitioned the later and changed its partition length to 1, it didn't help.2. the SpatialKey index order of both RDD is different before tileToLayout operation.For example, the former SpatialKey index order was :SpatialKey(0,0)SpatialKey(1,0)SpatialKey(0,1)SpatialKey(1,1)SpatialKey(2,0)SpatialKey(3,0)SpatialKey(2,1)SpatialKey(3,1)SpatialKey(0,2)SpatialKey(1,2)SpatialKey(0,3)SpatialKey(1,3)SpatialKey(2,2)SpatialKey(3,2)SpatialKey(2,3)SpatialKey(3,3)SpatialKey(4,0)SpatialKey(5,0)SpatialKey(4,1)SpatialKey(5,1)SpatialKey(4,2)SpatialKey(5,2)SpatialKey(4,3)SpatialKey(5,3)SpatialKey(0,4)SpatialKey(1,4)SpatialKey(2,4)SpatialKey(3,4)SpatialKey(4,4)SpatialKey(5,4)the later SpatialKey index order is:SpatialKey(3,1)SpatialKey(2,4)SpatialKey(3,2)SpatialKey(5,3)SpatialKey(4,0)SpatialKey(3,0)SpatialKey(0,4)SpatialKey(4,4)SpatialKey(0,0)SpatialKey(1,1)SpatialKey(2,2)SpatialKey(2,0)SpatialKey(0,1)SpatialKey(5,0)SpatialKey(3,4)SpatialKey(4,3)SpatialKey(1,4)SpatialKey(1,0)SpatialKey(2,3)SpatialKey(1,2)SpatialKey(2,1)SpatialKey(5,1)SpatialKey(4,1)SpatialKey(3,3)SpatialKey(1,3)SpatialKey(0,2)SpatialKey(5,4)SpatialKey(0,3)SpatialKey(5,2)SpatialKey(4,2)Why the former SpatialKey indexes is ordered in this way? I have no ideas.I was stucked here. Do you have any ideas or clue for the reason why the following function didn't work for the rsterRDD after transformation and actions in the spark.

echeipesh,"@david-2012 Neither the number of partitions nor the ordering of the keys would matter to the output of the pyramid. Matching up keys is taken care of by spark when working with `RDD[(K,V)]`. At a glance your function looks a lot like `Pyramid.levelStream` so you could double check if that surves your needs (https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/pyramid/Pyramid.scala#L131-L148). Not sure what could cause the ND tiles. The pixels of  tiles being merged as you go up the pyramid do not overlap, so its hard to blame anything about the merge function. Silly question but Is it possible to verify that whatever operations you_„Žre doing to the `rasterRDD` before prymid actually produces tiles with valid pixel values ? You can always pull a few out and use `Tile.ascriiDraw` on them or use `SinglebandGeoTiff` to write them out as a file.",11/24/16,1
lossyrob,"Also be wary of the CellType of your tiles. Some versions of geotrellis have bugs around merging tiles with certain cell types.

jeffreyhanson,"Hi, I've been working on an [R package](https://github.com/jeffreyhanson/geotrellis) to interface geotrellis with the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/).At the moment, the benchmaking suggests that geotrellis is fairly comparable with the popular R [raster package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/index.html).I was wondering if anyone would mind having a quick look to at the [Scala commands](https://github.com/jeffreyhanson/geotrellis/blob/master/R/zzz.R) and could recommend any alternative and higher performing implementations?",12/12/16,1
pomadchin,"@jeffreyhanson interesting, cool; have you been thinking on porting Spark parts on R? (http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sparkr.html)",12/12/16,1
fosskers,@jeffreyhanson how well does R's raster package scale?,12/12/16,1
jeffreyhanson,"@pomadchin I hadn't thought of that - that's a good idea. I haven't had a chance to play around with the spark parts yet. Do you expect greater performance for geoprocessing (eg. resampling) a single raster if it's accessed using the spark stuff?@fosskers I wouldn't use it for processing moderately big data sets (eg. global at 1km resolution). It has some capacity for using parallel processing, though it isn't available for all functions.The raster package is fairly good at scaling to a point. It's generally my go to for programming with raster data. If the users tries loading a raster that R can't fit into memory, then it stores the rasters on disk and can read the memory in chunks. But generally, R uses a lot of memory to store even simple objects, so some limitations may simply be due to the fact that some of it is written in R (some parts are written in C and called through R for speed). ",12/13/16,1
jeffreyhanson,I haven't had a chance to run the benchmarking using rasters with more than 1e+6 cells yet. I suspect once past 1e+8 the R raster package might fall behind geotrellis. ,12/13/16,1
pomadchin,@jeffreyhanson the _„ñfeature_„ of GeoTrellis that it processes tbs of data on a cluster; it makes sense ot load more than one raster into spark memory and to do whatever you want,12/13/16,1

pomadchin,"@Leme2014 we have an additional project https://github.com/azavea/geotrellis-geomesa-template-project/ and you can find in description how to launch geodocker on windows + you can even launch intelij idea in docker ^^ dunno why you may need it but it works :D \+ possible issues: https://github.com/azavea/geotrellis-geomesa-template-project/#possible-issues",12/21/16,1
jbouffard,"@metasim Alright. Thanks for testing it and letting me know. I think for right now I'll just include a step that involves installing `SpatialKey`. You shouldn't have to, as we're just dealing with one python file for right now.",12/21/16,1
metasim,"@jbouffard That said, I'm good with this.",12/21/16,1
metasim,Agreed.,12/21/16,1
metasim,"This python thing is a rabbit hole that goes much deeper than I imaginged. Lookthing through the pyspark source code, it looks like amplab/databricks bascially has parallel implementations of all the APIs, hand written. Quite an effort.",12/21/16,1
jbouffard,"@metasim I'm glad we were able to get it working. I'll try to make announcements when major milestones have been reached for the python bindings. Yeah, there's a lot that goes into PySpark and you realize how much needs to be done in order to the most basic of things.",12/21/16,1
metasim,"Having to create a serialization schema for every custom type just seems insane. In our case, all we need is NumPy array(s) of the raster in an RDD, and wanting to keep the heavyweight work in Scala/GeoTrellis, but even that... figuring out how to keep most of the RDD mechanics in JVM land is not something that is well documented (as you know).",12/21/16,1
metasim,Been surprised at how few examples are out there on doing something like this without a lot of boilerplate generation.,12/21/16,1
metasim,`</rant>` :-),12/21/16,1
jbouffard,"Luckily, we can produce schemas for our types on-the-fly, which we can then bring over to the python side; so that does save us some trouble. The real issue comes with serializing and deserializing. Yeah, there is almost nothing on this, and the only thing I we have to go on is the Spark source code. I thin it's kinda fun, though, breaking into whole new territory :smile: ",12/21/16,1
jbouffard,"@metasim I was able to send a `RDD[Extent]` from scala to python, modify the `Extent`s in python, send back the new `Extent`s to scala, and from the new data create a `RDD[RasterExtent]` .",12/22/16,1
jbouffard,Here's a link to that branch if you'd like to look at it: https://github.com/jbouffard/geopyspark/tree/avro,12/22/16,1
metasim,Super!!,12/22/16,1
metasim,I've not made any more progress on my end.... pulled into  meetings most of the week.,12/22/16,1
metasim,I'll check it out.,12/22/16,1
metasim,"@jbouffard Worked ""out of the box"" :)",12/22/16,1
jbouffard,@metasim That's alright! Glad it worked the way it was supposed to! :smile: ,12/22/16,1
ardilgulez,Is there a way in Geotrellis to import GRIB or NetCDF data?,12/22/16,1
metasim,"@ardilgulez FWIW, we're wanting the ability to import HDF-EOS files (kinda lik NetCDF). For the time being we have a GDAL script to get us to GeoTiff, and then into GeoTrellis. If we have the time, we'd love to write an HDF-EOF reader for GeoTrellis, but it's not on the critcal path ATM.",12/22/16,1
metasim, PS: @ardilgulez I'm not on the GeoTrellis team--just a recent user of it--so I don't know what the plans are for other formats beyond GeoTiff.,12/23/16,1
ardilgulez,"@lossyrob did something with NetCDF and Geotrellis, I'm guessing that it works too, so I thought there would be something more to work with",12/23/16,1
pomadchin,hi @ardilgulez we have an unclosed issue: https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/issues/1402 related to netcdf,12/23/16,1
pomadchin,we _had_ netcdf support before; it can be found here: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis-gdal (not up to date project though),12/23/16,1
pomadchin,"the problem of this project that it depends on gdal, that means you need to install gdal on all the nodes used to ingest your netcdf files, so the  easier solution would be to convert netcdf files into geotiffs using gdal (as a pre ingest step), and to ingest using geotrellis 1.0.0",12/23/16,1
ardilgulez,"I did that exact thing, used gdal_translate to convert a netcdf to tif",12/23/16,1
ardilgulez,"and I extracted a png out of it, all of it, and the png is 70x70",12/23/16,1
ardilgulez,the tif file covers an 8 degree by 8 degree area,12/23/16,1
ardilgulez,according to gdalinfo,12/23/16,1
ardilgulez,"by the way, did the ingestion process change when going into geotrellis 1.0?",12/23/16,1
pomadchin,"it is the same; but some refactors were done, ETL usage changed (it is json based in 1.0.0)",12/23/16,1
pomadchin,and some api changes ^^',12/23/16,1
ardilgulez,that might be what's biting me,12/23/16,1
ardilgulez,"``` scalaPyramid.upLevels(reprojected, layoutScheme, zoom, Bilinear) { (rdd, z) =>      val layerId = LayerId(""landsat"", z)      // If the layer exists already, delete it out before writing      if(attributeStore.layerExists(layerId)) {        new FileLayerManager(attributeStore).delete(layerId)      }      writer.write(layerId, rdd, ZCurveKeyIndexMethod)}```",12/23/16,1
pomadchin,think that would be quite the same,12/23/16,1
ardilgulez,I get some spray json blah blah error for the writer.write line,12/23/16,1
pomadchin,ah,12/23/16,1
ardilgulez,"the API looks the same, but I'm getting that error regardless",12/23/16,1
pomadchin,"be sure, that you have following imports```scalaimport geotrellis.spark._import geotrellis.spark.io._import geotrellis.spark.hadoop._import geotrellis.spark.file._```",12/23/16,1
pomadchin,"@ardilgulez noticed that you create new `FileLayerManager` on each pyramid step; you can move this function out of this function scope, that would be faster",12/23/16,1
pomadchin,and you can create just an instance of LayerDeleter ,12/23/16,1
ardilgulez,I am refactoring the landsat tutorial stuff,12/23/16,1
ardilgulez,"I did ""val flm = new FileLayerManager(attributeStore)""",12/23/16,1
ardilgulez,and flm.delete(layerId),12/23/16,1
ardilgulez,now I'm getting java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/spark/SparkContext,12/23/16,1
ardilgulez,nvm I think I know what it is,12/23/16,1
ardilgulez,I should install spark,12/23/16,1
ardilgulez,nvm it didn't work again,12/23/16,1
pomadchin,@ardilgulez have you included spark as a dep?,12/23/16,1
pomadchin,how do you launch your job? looks like without spark-submit,12/23/16,1
pomadchin,"to launch using `./sbt run` you need to include spark 2.0.2 dep and don_„Žt mark is as _„ñprovided""",12/23/16,1
ardilgulez,I cloned geotrellis sbt template and worked on it,12/23/16,1
ardilgulez,"It had spark dependency as ""provided""",12/23/16,1
ardilgulez,"deleting that ""provided"" solved",12/23/16,1
pomadchin,cool! @ardilgulez as well im updating chatta demo to use geotrellis collections api; probably that may be interesting for you,12/23/16,1
david-2012,"Hi, @pomadchin  @lossyrob Recently when we use geotrellis to import some big-size tiff file(In our case, global land cover data with 250m resolution, 400M with LZW compression, about 12G after uncompression) into accumulo, it threw some exceptions.When loading the uncompressed 12GB global land cover tiff data, it threw the following error:16/12/26 15:34:13 ERROR Executor: Exception in task 0.0 in stage 0.0 (TID 0)java.lang.RuntimeException: Cannot read path file:/data/raster/Param/LandCover/global/2014_2014_0.00208_1y_Raster_2014/Raster_LandCover_global_0.00208_1y_2014_2014.tif because it's too big...when loading the LZW-compressed 400M tiff data, it threw the following error:(run-main-0) org.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted due to stage failure: Task 0 in stage 0.0 failed 1 times, most recent failure: Lost task 0.0 in stage 0.0 (TID 0, localhost): java.lang.NegativeArraySizeExceptionDo you have any solutions or suggestions to handle with this big-size tiff file?

pomadchin,@MichiB7_twitter what EMR version do you use? the latest?,1/10/17,1
MichiB7_twitter,We used the EMR version 5.2.0,1/10/17,1
lossyrob,I do think this should read different https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/blame/_old/master/raster/src/main/scala/geotrellis/raster/ArrayTile.scala#L45,1/10/17,1
lossyrob,because there_„Žs no data loss going from a non-floating point to a floating point,1/10/17,1
lossyrob,eh actually if you go from Int to Float...,1/10/17,1
lossyrob,but that_„Žs true between most datatypes,1/10/17,1
lossyrob,"so ArrayTile extends LazyLogging, which has a `logger`, which in this case in null. because it_„Žs transient. however we haven_„Žt run into this problem..interesting",1/10/17,1
lossyrob,how is the tile being serialized?,1/10/17,1
lossyrob,hmm we might not notice this because we use Kryo and don_„Žt ever close over a Tile,1/10/17,1
pomadchin,we can run a small job in theory and to make this operation ,1/10/17,1
lossyrob,Is the Tile that_„Žs causing the NPE being serialized via a closure (so definitely using java serialization) or via a shuffle (so could use Kryo or Java ser),1/10/17,1
lossyrob,true. and then we_„Žd have to come up with a fix_„_lazy logging might not be the best choice for our serializable types if this is indeed what_„Žs happening,1/10/17,1
echeipesh,Actually looks like its `@volatile` `@transient` would have made it survive serialization,1/10/17,1
echeipesh,https://github.com/typesafehub/scala-logging/blob/3a821e304d8fb3993ce2c5fb69387d336c65a08a/src/main/scala/com/typesafe/scalalogging/Logging.scala#L27,1/10/17,1
pomadchin,@echeipesh where is this logger marked as transient?,1/10/17,1
lossyrob,https://github.com/typesafehub/scala-logging/blob/v3.5.0/src/main/scala/com/typesafe/scalalogging/Logging.scala,1/10/17,1
lossyrob,the released version doesn_„Žt have @volatile,1/10/17,1
pomadchin,ah,1/10/17,1
lossyrob,ah so it_„Žs not marked transient,1/10/17,1
lossyrob,so we need to wrap it into something with transient,1/10/17,1
pomadchin,it_„Žs serializable ,1/10/17,1
pomadchin,https://github.com/typesafehub/scala-logging/pull/52,1/10/17,1
lossyrob,it_„Žs the lazy val though,1/10/17,1
lossyrob,is what eugene says,1/10/17,1
echeipesh,"It_„Žs not. I just know that I have made `@transient lazy val logger` which makes it survive serialization. Basically it gets serialized as un-initinitlized lazy val, which causes it to be re-inited.",1/10/17,1
pomadchin,we had a discussion here btw: https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/issues/1408,1/10/17,1
MichiB7_twitter,Our exception is refering to the class ``,1/10/17,1
lossyrob,this is what seems to be going on https://github.com/typesafehub/scala-logging/pull/52 and they say it_„Žs fixed,1/10/17,1
pomadchin,++,1/10/17,1
MichiB7_twitter,Our exception is refering to the class `org.slf4j.impl.Log4jLoggerAdapter` where the logger is marked transient,1/10/17,1
lossyrob,is there any way the version of scala-logging is getting kicked out for an older version?,1/10/17,1
pomadchin,so we need to try to recreate things and potentially that may be a problem of emr logger version or smth else,1/10/17,1
echeipesh,"We should def try to recreate this. The test is to trigger logging before serialization, then attempt to use it again post serialization.",1/10/17,1
lossyrob,@MichiB7_twitter one quick fix thing to try in the meantime is to use Kryo serialization if you_„Žre not already doing so,1/10/17,1
MichiB7_twitter,"@lossyrob Sorry Rob, I'm new in this project and in GeoTrellis. How do I find out which serialization is used and how can I set it? ",1/10/17,1
MichiB7_twitter,"@lossyrob In our project we are using Kryo registration and after we registered the `org.slf4j.impl.Log4jLoggerAdapter` we got the NPE. So I think we are already using Kryo serialization.",1/10/17,1
pomadchin,"@MichiB7_twitter during the spark conext creation you can setup spark configuration for this context: ```scala  val conf =     new SparkConf()      .setAppName(""ChattaDemo"")      .set(""spark.serializer"", ""org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer"")      .set(""spark.kryo.registrator"", ""geotrellis.spark.io.kryo.KryoRegistrator"")    implicit val sparkContext = new SparkContext(conf)```",1/10/17,1
pomadchin,aha,1/10/17,1
pomadchin,interesting,1/10/17,1
lossyrob,@MichiB7_twitter sorry yeah it_„Žs a Spark thing. You can set it into the SparkConf like @pomadchin mentioned or on the `spark-submit` side via a `_„îconf`http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html#compression-and-serialization,1/10/17,1
pomadchin,@MichiB7_twitter you said that you registered it; that means that you had kryo serialization exceptions?,1/10/17,1
pomadchin,and can you throw here usage example of this function you use? ,1/10/17,1
pomadchin,```rdd.map(Ndvi)``` ?,1/10/17,1
MichiB7_twitter,"@pomadchin Yes, I registered the 'org.slf4j.impl.Log4jLoggerAdapter' class. Before that I had a Kryo not registered exception",1/10/17,1
pomadchin,ok,1/10/17,1
echeipesh,Thats kinda strange. What was the exception? Not every class needs to be registered with kryo for it to function unless `spark.kryo.registrationRequired=true`,1/10/17,1
MichiB7_twitter,"`val ndviPixels: RDD[(ProjectedExtent, Tile)] = sceneRdd.mapValues(Ndvi(_))`",1/10/17,1

pomadchin,@echeipesh i can try to check it on landsat emr demo,1/10/17,1
MichiB7_twitter,"@echeipesh Yes, we use `.set(""spark.kryo.registrationRequired"", ""true"")`",1/10/17,1
echeipesh,"Ok, that makes sense. Disabling it would change the way the class is indexed but it shouldn_„Žt change any of the machanics of how it is serialized, so nothing else to be said there I think.",1/10/17,1
MichiB7_twitter,"I have an assumption but I have to test it tomorrow in more detail. On a first sight, with EMR 5.0.0 I got no Error. With EMR 5.2.0 the error occurs. But this really only a first sight. I saw this in the cluster logs.

metasim,Still wrapping my brain around the problem.,1/18/17,1
echeipesh,Makes sense. Have you played much with DataFrames ? An intuition that I have is that it might be more useful to provide a mapping to DataFrame structs from GT types (since we seem to be forced to map to primitives anyway),1/18/17,1
metasim,Right.... I've been using them (here) interchangeably. I usually start with `DataSet`s but eventually bail on the types. (and use `DataFrame`s).,1/18/17,1

hjaekel,@pomadchin We upgraded the scala-landsat-util to the new sat-api. Are there any plans to transform the scala-landsat-util to scala-sat-util? We need  the same functionality for Sentinel (thats why we are also working on geotrellis-gdal) and we are currently discussing how to proceed.,1/24/17,1
echeipesh,"@hjaekel we didn_„Žt really have plans, but that makes a lot of sense. We_„Žd have to figure out how to deliver it, a mini library for each supported catalog probably (?). If you want to spike out that code we_„Žll definatly find a home for it in that project.",1/24/17,1
pomadchin,"@hjaekel yes, noticed; great prs ^^_„Ž",1/24/17,1
echeipesh,"^ Ah, I see the PR.",1/24/17,1
metasim,"@hjaekel To be super general, we should consider what it would take to interface via NASA's Central Metadata Repository (CMR), which intends to be the centralized point of search and access (either via download links or data product ordering). The catalog is quite extensive.https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/site/search_api_docs.htmlIt won't handle the cases where the data is mirrored by AWS or Google Earth Engine, etc.",1/24/17,1
metasim,"You can manually see what's available here:https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov",1/24/17,1
metasim,"Not trying to encourage scope creep, but having a Scala API over that system would be significant. I've considered implementing it several times myself, but keep getting pulled off to other more pressing things.",1/24/17,1
metasim,"We've talked to some folks at NASA about it, and it appears that NASA & USGS (maybe NOAA) are actually committed to getting a centralized system be the go-to place for discovering data assets.",1/24/17,1
echeipesh,"That NASA query API doesn_„Žt look too intense at first glance, not sure how many return types are there. Also knowing the AWS/Google mirror is pretty useful because to get the bytes cheap.",1/24/17,1
hjaekel,@metasim I will look at it,1/24/17,1
pomadchin,I tried to do smth like that but for landsat api to get tiles directly from usgs (as amazon and google have not complete sets of lc scenes); but it was ugly (i needed to auth and to download scene :D),1/24/17,1
metasim,"I did the same with USGS, even generating SOAP classes via XSD. Indeed messy. CMR is much cleaner.",1/24/17,1
metasim,At least from looking at the docs.,1/24/17,1
metasim,"Also generated bindings for MODIS/MODAPS; cleaner, but very limited.",1/24/17,1
hjaekel,"I think an abstract search api with the possibility to add custom catalogs as suggested by @echeipesh would be the most flexible approach. Downloading is also an issue, especially when different platforms offer the same data in different formats.",1/24/17,1
metasim,"Fortunately, if architected properly, the separation between ""what's available"" and ""how do I get it"" allows for multiple ""fetch"" backends. Once you know the granule or scene ID from a CMR search, you can use that to poke AWS/Google/Azure to see if they have it available, and fall back to the authoratative source if necessary.",1/24/17,1
metasim,"In our case, the multi-spectral products hosted by AWS, etc. aren't really useful because they haven't been calibrated to the quality degree we need, so our use cases lean toward getting from the official sources anyway.",1/24/17,1
hjaekel,@metasim maybe downloading should be separated from the search,1/24/17,1
hjaekel,It seems to bring its own complexity,1/24/17,1
metasim,"Yeh, that's what I'm trying to say.",1/24/17,1
metasim,"The results you get from CMR are of two forms (generally): URI of where to download the data, or URI and other metadata on how to order what you want (e.g. you want some higher-level data product that hasn't been computted yet).",1/24/17,1
metasim,"In the latter case you have to either poll the system for completion, which then gives you the download URI, or you have to have an email handler to receive the compute status messages.",1/24/17,1
metasim,"IMO, getting the searching API right is the critical part.",1/24/17,1
metasim,The download API is probably a moving target as this industry evolves,1/24/17,1
hjaekel,"Yes, it's a moving target. Here in Europe there are several initiatives for building up new distribution services",1/24/17,1
metasim,"Here in the USA, our government likes to reinvent the wheel at least 4 time before acknowledging any commonality in mission ;-) So CMR is actually some measureable progress!",1/24/17,1

lossyrob,"and if not, collaborating on building it :)",1/24/17,1
metasim,"Short answer: no. Where I left off with it was trying to figure out which of the [multiple output schema specifications](https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/site/search_api_docs.html#supported-result-formats) it supports would be most amenable to  Scala boilerplate generation. I was starting to think that just hand writing would be the right approach... it's not even clear to me if the request side has a schema. USGS EarthExplorer had a SOAP 1.0 API which, while ugly, allowed generation of a scalaxb API.",1/24/17,1
metasim,"I'm not an expert at theses REST-y JavaScript-y things, so I never know if something doesn't exist because I don't know where to look, or if it just doesn't exist.",1/24/17,1
metasim,So I got stalled by analysis paralysis :/,1/24/17,1
lossyrob,"Gotcha. We have some work that a lib like that would be great for, so I think we_„Žll end up building it one way or the other. When that starts up I_„Žll make sure to loop you in (and anyone else here who is interested)",1/24/17,1
metasim,"If someone has a strong opinion or guidance on how to approach writing an API against a public REST API such as this, I'd like to hear it, and would be willing to do the leg work of getting a prototype running.",1/24/17,1

dorukozturk,ok so I am trying to do everything locally on my laptop. I am trying to mimic AWS deployment so that is why I want accumulo so that I can try to ingest 1 layer and see how it is behaving,2/4/17,1
dorukozturk,so I decided to go for the geodocker-accumulo,2/4/17,1
dorukozturk,so it will be all in my local machine (ingest and everything),2/4/17,1
dorukozturk,so when I do docker-compose up I can go to http://localhost:50095/master and http://localhost:50070/ so both hdfs and accumulo are running. You are saying maybe my zookeeper config is borked?,2/4/17,1

dorukozturk,"okay now I see, I just need to forward the ports ",2/4/17,1
pomadchin,with geodocker i prefer to laucnh spark in docker; to mount neccesary jars / dirs into spark container and to launch jobs from this spark container,2/4/17,1
pomadchin,uis only forwarded in this example; to have a simple access via browser,2/4/17,1

pomadchin,\+ double check what zookeeper would have; potentially it may have _internal_ tserver addresses,2/4/17,1

metasim,"@pomadchin I've had to focus on business things the past week, only getting fractured minutes to look at the avro2spark work. To do it correctly I think we need to go through the `org.apache.spark.sql.Encoder[T]` API. I reached out to the GeoMesa guys to see how much of the Catalyst work they did overlapped with the `Encoder[T]` API. While there is some overlap, it's not an exact match (but got some good pointers into their source). The current approach to writing the `Encoder`s reminds me of writing a javac annotation processor plugin (or Scala macros before quasiquotes) where you have to procedurally construct an AST for future evaluation. While it's a [public API](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/encoders/ExpressionEncoder.scala), I've not found any examples of how to make use of it outside of Catalyst itself.

lossyrob,"right. I just think that because it_„Žs flushing to disk, there is serialization implied ",2/6/17,1
lossyrob,not sure how you avoid serialization when saving to disk,2/6/17,1
moradology,@Leonhalt3141 let me know if you run into any specific problems or questions. it seems like you've used slick before and might already understand your next steps,2/6/17,1
schBen,@lossyrob that sounds logical,2/6/17,1
schBen,"but if that's right and the error has something to do with serialization, why does it disappear at `MEMORY_ONLY_SER`",2/6/17,1
lossyrob,good question,2/6/17,1
lossyrob,could it be a case where the way it is ser/deser to/from disk is different then memory?,2/6/17,1
lossyrob,"so persisting MEMORY_ONLY and MEMORY_ONLY_SER don_„Žt fail, but MEMORY_AND_DISK, MEMORY_AND_DISK_SER, and DISK_ONLY fail?",2/6/17,1
schBen,I will check it once again for all the cases,2/6/17,1
schBen,"@lossyrob I made a quick test. `MEMORY_ONLY` and `MEMORY_AND_DISK` had failed tasks. `DISK_ONLY`, `MEMORY_AND_DISK_SER` and `MEMORY_ONLY_SER` didn't.",2/6/17,1
lossyrob,interesting. so it_„Žs actually the non-serialization memory case that is failing,2/6/17,1
lossyrob,"so if it stores _„ƒwithout serialization_„Ž, how does that affect the transient vals of an instance?",2/6/17,1
pomadchin,mb it_„Žs a _spark feature_ ?,2/6/17,1
schBen,"@lossyrob yes, it seems so. @pomadchin well at least I couldn't find this feature in the manual  :sweat_smile:",2/6/17,1
schBen,http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/programming-guide.html#rdd-persistence,2/6/17,1

schBen,"yes, we only had it after upgrading Spark",2/6/17,1
lossyrob,from what to what?,2/6/17,1
pomadchin,"@schBen ye, that is why it is a _feature_",2/6/17,1
schBen,from 1.6.1 to 2.0.2,2/6/17,1
lossyrob,@pomadchin lol. the sarcasm is thick,2/6/17,1
lossyrob,ok interesting,2/6/17,1
lossyrob,it seems like it might be a spark bug,2/6/17,1
schBen,okay. or we just do something weird in our application,2/6/17,1
schBen,at least something you're not supposed to do with spark,2/6/17,1
lossyrob,seems like pretty standard usage though...,2/6/17,1
lossyrob,I wish I could find where in code that caching happens to get a better idea of what is actually going on,2/6/17,1
lossyrob,"`persist` on RDD simply marks it to be persisted, and some other mechanism does the actual persisting (I_„Žm looking in the DAGScheduler currently)",2/6/17,1
hjaekel,@lossyrob what do you think of our way of parallelizing the batch jobs [ParSeq](https://github.com/gaf-ag/ndvi-demo.app/blob/master/ndvi-demo/src/main/scala/de/gaf/demo/apps/NdviWorkflow.scala#L69)?,2/6/17,1
schBen,yeah I understood that RDDs are _marked_ for persistence first. And they get actually persisted when you call the first action on them. ,2/6/17,1
lossyrob,"@hjaekel I think that the way your doing it is executing jobs in parallel on a spark master, which can cause a bottleneck just based on how spark parallelizes job execution",2/6/17,1
echeipesh,^ https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/job-scheduling.html#scheduling-within-an-application,2/6/17,1
lossyrob,we_„Žve run into similar questions. @echeipesh has said there_„Žs a way to increase parallelism via configuration. ,2/6/17,1
lossyrob,"there_„Žs also potentially a way to ingest multiple layers as one RDD, which I_„Žve explored a bit but haven_„Žt sat down and fought through coding",2/6/17,1
echeipesh,"Basically you can submit multiple jobs in parallel and thats cool, but its up to the scheduler to decide how the tasks get scheduled and executed. So for instance you have to configure to do fair scheduling to round robin through all the jobs (executing them incrementally). I believe the default behavior is to wait for each individual job to be complated.",2/6/17,1
echeipesh,"I seem to recall that when we were submitting jobs to Mesos in fine-grained scheduling mode it would actually run them in parallel and dynamically scale the executors, not sure if that_„Žs still the case.",2/6/17,1
hjaekel,"ok, we already saw that bottleneck on the master. we chose FIFO scheduling so that all the processed results do not arrive at the same time on the master, but that does not work out very well",2/6/17,1
echeipesh,collecting the results is blowing the heap ?,2/6/17,1
hjaekel,could be. we used a master with -Xmx51G,2/6/17,1
schBen,"but don't Spark's ""out-of-heapspace"" exceptions look different? we had something like that before",2/6/17,1
echeipesh,"well, there is lots of heaps, so if you run out of heap on executors it fails different from when the master runs out of heap. I_„Žm not sure what @hjaekel is trying to optimize for. Is it memory usage on master or trying to increase job parallism ?",2/6/17,1
lossyrob,have you tried the FAIR scheduler and found problems?,2/6/17,1
hjaekel,"with spark 1.6.1, we chose a configuration with 10 executors on 2 workers and then we scaled the master so that no OutOfMemoryErrors occured. If we increase the number of executors, we also have to increase parallelism, otherwise executors are idle. In that case, we also have to increase memory on the master",2/6/17,1
lossyrob,"a bit confused, the number of executors shouldn_„Žt effect the memory of the master",2/6/17,1
lossyrob,because the work executing on the executors doesn_„Žt play into master memory,2/6/17,1
lossyrob,"the thing we_„Žve found is when we have a lot of tasks (like 50000) we can end up running out of mem on the master because it has to track the DAG in a really complex and heavy graph, but I_„Žm not sure about the situation you_„Žre talking about",2/6/17,1
hjaekel,"the `stitch` is executed on the master, and if you have too many parallel tasks, the master has to execute many parallel stitches",2/6/17,1
schBen,"that's for sure an issue... but we thought it would not be directly linked to the ""persist"" thing",2/6/17,1
lossyrob,"ah gotcha. If you_„Žre stitching, you_„Žre doing large collects_„_I would wonder if there_„Žd be a way around that",2/6/17,1
lossyrob,true I don_„Žt think the persist thing and the parallelization issue are tied. Though I_„Žm confused enough about the persist bug that I wouldn_„Žt say anything definitively...,2/6/17,1
schBen,okay sure :-) ,2/6/17,1
kthompson,"Hi I posted this PR, I am looking for some feedback  on it. https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/pull/2001",2/6/17,1

kthompson,@lossyrob sure thing,2/6/17,1
Leonhalt3141,"@lossyrob @moradology  Thank you for your kind reply. Actually, I would like to manage satellite imageries with PostGIS. To know coverage location of image, I need to set a column of geometry Polygon in the table. But I don_„Žt know how to  define Polygon in Scala codes.  Is there any class for PostGIS Polygon geometry, or just set as String type and convert to geometry each time?",2/7/17,1
mattfullerton,"Hi everyone, was redirected here from GitHub (https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis-landsat-tutorial/issues/5#issuecomment-277842088) - to get back on that, I also get the failure doing a boring lynx localhost:8089 (I had to change the port in my case), except I can see the 404 first appearing and then I get the Resource could not be found thing.",2/7/17,1
mattfullerton,"To be honest though this is partly just a symptom of a larger understanding problem of mine; I was familiar with the geotrellis catalog form from ca. October 2015, when the viewer/sample catalog were still in the main repo. As far as I can tell, a lot has changed since then. This landsat tutorial outputs a big catalog but actually no master JSON file explain what data stores should be in there, which I would have been expecting. Is there an overview anywhere of the current catalog format and how one goes about building one ""by hand"" (i.e. setting up the catalog JSON and outputting converted files from gtloader). My overall aim is to serve a catalog from s3 for the geotrellis-admin project. But I am lacking info on what exactly should be sitting in S3 and thought I would start with the output of the landsat tutorial project.",2/7/17,1
echeipesh,@Leonhalt3141 The types for columns and their projections is what `geotrellis-slick` adds. You can see the use of geometry type without projection here (https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/blob/master/slick/src/test/scala/geotrellis/slick/PostgisSpec.scala#L52) and with projection SRID here (https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/blob/master/slick/src/test/scala/geotrellis/slick/PostGisProjectionSupportSpec.scala#L38). The latter will satisffy SRID constraints on a PostGIS geometry column. (There is support for Polygon in similar manner),2/7/17,1
echeipesh,@mattfullerton Did @pomadchin suggestion to change `localhost` to `0.0.0.0` in `Server.scala` make any difference for you?,2/7/17,1
echeipesh,The catalog really has changed a lot since 0.9. We basically used to store images of arbitrary size and then clip them to extract the rasters we needed. The catalog/layer concept right now is more of an image pyramid which stores tiles on a regular grid and you can find the metadata we store in the `_attributes` directory.,2/7/17,1
echeipesh,"There really isn_„Žt a fisible manual way to create this pyramid, you either do the process which is shown in `IngestImage.scala`, where you have a lot of control over the data, or you can use the spark ETL wrapper around that process discussed here (http://geotrellis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/etl-tutorial/). ",2/7/17,1
mattfullerton,OK. Thanks for the explanation. But the output from the tutorial is a bona fide catalog which I could put as is in an S3 bucket and explorer using geotrellis-admim?,2/7/17,1
mattfullerton,@echeipesh Just tried localhost->0.0.0.0 - no difference,2/7/17,1
mattfullerton,"To be clear, I'm almost certain I'm communicating with the Spray app - its just not returning me anything",2/7/17,1
mattfullerton,"(also tried /static, /static/index.html, /index.html...)",2/7/17,1
echeipesh,"Yep, you_„Žd have to switch from using `FileLayerWrter` to `S3LayerWriter` (and realted `S3AttributeStore`, `S3LayerManager`) https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis-landsat-tutorial/blob/master/src/main/scala/tutorial/IngestImage.scala#L89",2/7/17,1
mattfullerton,I can't just copy the files across?,2/7/17,1
echeipesh,"The matadata is going to be slightly off, its going to be talking about file locations on the file system vs S3 buckets. Its probably easier to re-write them rather than going to change the metadata by hand.",2/7/17,1

I'm having a hard time finding the exact workflow to make this happen even though it appears to be fairly straightforward, so I feel like I must be missing something essential. Using the Kernel tutorial and https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis-landsat-tutorial/blob/master/src/main/scala/tutorial/IngestImage.scala I've managed to represent some dummy data as an array of Features, but actually getting that array into an RDD that `Pyramid.uplevels` accepts has been troublesome.",2/10/17,1

echeipesh,@cepkoCC Looks like you_„Žre just trying to do a kernel density over the points? If so we have a specific feature to do that to an RDD of points and the test should be pretty helpful as an example: https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/test/scala/geotrellis/spark/density/RDDKernelDensitySpec.scala#L76,2/10/17,1
cepkoCC,oh awesome! I'll give this a try,2/10/17,1
lossyrob,"For conversion of vector to raster, there_„Žs kernel density, and also just straight rasterization",2/10/17,1

lossyrob,that_„Žs better for polygon rasterizaiton. for Points just doing a RasterExtent.mapToGrid transformation to get the cell values is easy,2/10/17,1
lossyrob,as the count points example shows,2/10/17,1
lossyrob,"to do something like that in an RDD, it_„Žs pretty straight forward, but would require some setup to create the appropriate RDD with metadata, then parallize over potential intersecting spatial keys, broadcast the points, map to an option tile if there are intersecting points (with the tile being the rasterized version), and then flatten to get rid of Nones.

The problem has to do with a depth misalignment between the *Spark* schema translated by `spark-avro` and the actual Avro `GenericRecord`instances generated in the translation when `UNION` types are involved. The Spark schema has an extra `StructType` in the hierarchy declaring the various union options, whereas the Avro `GenericRecord` instances don't have any intermediate representation (because it supports union properly). I'm having to revisit some of my assumptions to be more flexible in this regard. When dealing with two different schemas and three different data formats, it's easy to get my wires crossed.",2/14/17,1

I was trying to modify this script in order to ingest a Sentinel-2 image to Accumulo. This way, i utilized the corresponding code for Accumulo from here http://geotrellis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/tile-backends.html (and replaced FileAttributeStore, FileLayerWriter, FileLayerManager in the original script). As I have told you, this script ran with SocketWriteStrategy(), but with HdfsWriteStrategy, I get the ""mkdirs failed to create /geotrellis-ingest/..."" IO error. Then, i tried to run the server and viewer code from  https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis-landsat-emr-demo for my case. The codes run without error, but in the end I was not able to see my image on localhost. I understand that these questions are quite abstract, but i am new to all these technologies and maybe i am missing something fundamental.

echeipesh,"@metasim Ah, interesting. The normal workflow for Avro is actually to go from schema to encoders/decorders (through code-gen). The thing we did with geotrellis where we assemble encoders/decoders at compile time is not a standard solution. The lookup for subclass (a member of the union) being compatabable with the schema for the superclass (a union) is part of the Avro spec, so we actually can change that implementation to return full union without breaking any contracts. I still need to look at your code a bit closer to fully grok how this is breaking things though.",2/15/17,1

pomadchin,@karalas https://github.com/geodocker/geodocker-accumulo,2/15/17,1
echeipesh,"@prahim That_„Žs not really possible since the query planning happens before any I/O, this process of course doesn_„Žt know if tile it will fetch do or do not have any data. However, if the tile is all NoData values it will be very compressable and it can be filtered out as the first step. If this is something that is very important one can imagine achieving this using storgage that has some storage side processing, like Accumulo. (I don_„Žt kow how commited to this you are however).",2/15/17,1
echeipesh,@karalas What is your cluster environment? You may need to pay attention to the user that starts the spark job. It is somewhat common for the HDFS to be only accessible by either `hdfs` user or members of `hadoop` group. Likely you are starting spark as some other user and it is being denied. This kind of mismatch is most often the cause of these errors.,2/15/17,1
echeipesh,Looking over the user related games played in the geodocker images would also be good reference as @pomadchin is saying.,2/15/17,1
metasim,"@echeipesh Thanks for that background info. I'm going to look some more into a work around. The breakage is assoicated with assumptions the `spark-avro` library makes, where, at least when you use the library for IO, it maintains a wrapper around the resolved union with a `StructType` with nullable elements.",2/15/17,1
echeipesh,"Ah gotcha, it materialized the union so to speak.",2/15/17,1

You'll see that the Spark schema from `spark-avro` represents each union option as a nullable field with names like `member0`, `member1`, etc. If we knew which of the Avro union items matched we might be able to reconstruct that field, but I'm not seeing an easy way of determining the index of the schema that matched in `AvroUnionCodec`.",2/15/17,1

prahim,@lossyrob really? it seems that ingest is writing nodata tiles to the store ... ,2/16/17,1
prahim,@pomadchin Thank you.. let me try that out,2/16/17,1
lossyrob,"ah, really. Perhaps by default it doesn_„Žt remove nodata tiles, but that_„Žs a common step to filter before writing",2/16/17,1
prahim,is there a better way to filter it than the way I am currently doing it? @lossyrob ,2/16/17,1
lossyrob,you can do it when you are writing the layer into the backend,2/16/17,1
lossyrob,you can check the tile values for a method_„_one sec,2/16/17,1
lossyrob,https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/blob/master/raster/src/main/scala/geotrellis/raster/Tile.scala#L223,2/16/17,1
prahim,hmm I think that is what I am doing ```tileLayerRdd.filter(!_._2.isNoDataTile)``` @lossyrob ,2/16/17,1
lossyrob,"yeah. Are you doing that on the fetch side? That will still bring down the tiles. When the layers are initially saved, if the same sort of filter is done, it_„Žll avoid storing them at all",2/16/17,1
prahim,"Yea it's done on the write side-- I am not sure how to make the new metadata to match my filtered rdd though ...  it can't find the definition for rdd if I do `fromRdd[ProjectedExtent, Tile, SpatialKey]` ... it finds it if I do `fromRdd[SpatialKey, Tile, SpatialKey]` but then has errors regarding implicits",2/16/17,1

prahim,thank you!!!,2/16/17,1
lossyrob,no problem!,2/16/17,1
prahim,now if I read it out I would expect metadataReader.read(layerId).spatialKeys to only contain spatialKeys for the tiles I saved -- is that not true?,2/16/17,1
prahim,I have 29 tiles I saved but I have thousands of spatialKeys when I read the metadata back,2/16/17,1
lossyrob,"The metadata will describe an area that can cover more keys, but only those keys that exist will be read in",2/16/17,1
prahim,so if I use the `CollectionLayerReader` it should only read for the existing keys?,2/16/17,1
lossyrob,yup,2/16/17,1
prahim,hmm it doesn't automatically do it if I just call collectionlayerReader.read(layerId) but we don't do anything with the spatial keys when reading ... I tried to add some logic by getting the metadata.spatialKeys and only reading those keys but all keys including keys that don't exist come back in that array,2/16/17,1
prahim,should I set filterIndexOnly ? what would that do,2/16/17,1
prahim,I think there is a problem with the way we are storing our spatial keys. I will modify that. Thank you for your help!,2/16/17,1
lossyrob,Hm interesting,2/16/17,1
lossyrob,The spatial keys that are stored should only be the ones that are written,2/16/17,1
lossyrob,filterIndexOnly will bring back some false positives for bounding box/polygon queries,2/16/17,1
prahim,we were deriving the spatialkeys based on the extent so it was storing more than actually existed,2/16/17,1
prahim,I fixed that issue and now we are only storing the spatialkeys that actually exist ... the CollectionLayerReader didn't read based off the spatialkeys though ...,2/16/17,1
lossyrob,"how do you mean, based off the spatial keys?",2/16/17,1
prahim,"I have 29 spatial keys but it was trying to fetch tiles for over 2000 spatialkeys .. If I explicitly read for each spatial key then it only reads for the 29 existing keys like:```val spatialKeys: Array[SpatialKey] = tileLayerMetadata.spatialKeysval tilesSeq = spatialKeys.map { spatialKey =>        (spatialKey, cachingTileReader.read(layerId, spatialKey))      }```",2/16/17,1
prahim,now the metadata returns the right set of keys after fixing the storing,2/16/17,1
prahim,but if I just use collectionLayerReader.read(layerId) it tries to read for keys that don't exist,2/16/17,1
prahim,it is using the `S3CollectionReader` btw,2/16/17,1
lossyrob,"ah it tries to read keys that don_„Žt exist, but doesn_„Žt actually read them",2/16/17,1
prahim,yea so it 404s,2/16/17,1
lossyrob,and you_„Žre trying to avoid that. for performance?,2/16/17,1
prahim,yes! too slow,2/16/17,1
lossyrob,gotcha,2/16/17,1
prahim,it that an improvement that could get added?,2/16/17,1
lossyrob,I_„Žm wondering why there_„Žs so many missing spatial keys?,2/16/17,1
lossyrob,is it one layer that has sparsely populated areas?,2/16/17,1
prahim,yes there's data in the upper left corner and lower right corner and nothing in the middle,2/16/17,1
lossyrob,"yeah, that_„Žs a use case we haven_„Žt thought through enough TBH",2/16/17,1
lossyrob,and they shouldn_„Žt be 2 different layers,2/16/17,1
lossyrob,?,2/16/17,1
prahim,yea we treat it as one layer for how we use the information,2/16/17,1
lossyrob,it_„Žs a good point,2/16/17,1
lossyrob,"and there are solutions, but the ones I can immediately think of go a bit deep",2/16/17,1
echeipesh,"yeap, potentially using the `HadoopValueReader` with `s3a://` URI would be a way around this, because it stores mapfiles which are sorted, packed and indexed. But using it may be a little tricky because of common dependency clashes with EMR. Also its not a well benchmarked approach. But in theory it would be more efficient for these very sparse layers.",2/16/17,1
lossyrob,"Potentially we could store key range metadata optionally. Which would be an unnecessary hit for full layers, but a good fit for sparse layers",2/16/17,1
lossyrob,Sparse layer support could be a feature for 1.1,2/16/17,1
prahim,Yay! Does 1.1 have an estimated release date?,2/16/17,1

prahim,okay sounds good ... we need a way to get ours working right now.. I can submit a PR ,2/16/17,1
lossyrob,I can think of a workaround,2/16/17,1
lossyrob,so if you know the extents of the sparse sets,2/16/17,1
lossyrob,you can store that in the attribute metadata,2/16/17,1
lossyrob,"and if you pull that down, use that as part of a MultiPolygon Intersection layer filter",2/16/17,1
prahim,ohh ,2/16/17,1
prahim,can I generate a multipolygon based on spatial keys?,2/16/17,1
prahim,instead of extent?,2/16/17,1
lossyrob,extent has a `.toPolygon`,2/16/17,1

rgwozdz,Awesome!  thanks very much,2/19/17,1

pomadchin,"@dorukozturk in case of accumulo we don't work explicitly with zookeepers, it's a driver work as you could notice; so yes, smth is wrong with your cluster setup.",2/21/17,1

pomadchin,"hm, i think it_„Žs possible ofc to calculate that distance using plain geometries but it would be rather rough and you need to reproject points into some certain projection",2/21/17,1

pomadchin,@fosskers ahaha,2/22/17,1

lossyrob,trollin,2/22/17,1
pomadchin,:d ,2/22/17,1
lossyrob,@prahim It should represent the extent of the actual data,2/22/17,1
lossyrob,how did you filter nodata tiles?,2/22/17,1
fosskers,"yml was serious, Dhall was half. It's still pretty alpha and probably won't hit critical mass",2/22/17,1
prahim,"hey @lossyrob ! I did it with you last week: ```val filteredTiles: ContextRDD[SpatialKey, Tile, TileLayerMetadata[SpatialKey]] =              tileLayerRdd.withContext(rdd => rdd.filter(!_._2.isNoDataTile))```",2/22/17,1
lossyrob,"hi! you're just passing forward the context (which is the metadata), so the extent shouldn_„Žt change at all",2/22/17,1
prahim,so the problem now is that when we read back the tiles stitched up with the extent it is misaligned ... if I put back the nodata tiles everything is fine,2/22/17,1
prahim,yea so the extent didn't change so it was not aligned correctly then I udpated the extent and it aligned,2/22/17,1
prahim,but that doesn't make sense,2/22/17,1
prahim,"```            val newMetadata = filteredTiles.metadata.updateBounds(              Bounds(minSpatialKey, maxSpatialKey)            )```",2/22/17,1
prahim,where minSpatialKey and maxSpatialKey are from the filteredTiles new spatialKey set ,2/22/17,1
lossyrob,the extent shouldn_„Žt be used during stitching,2/22/17,1
lossyrob,I don_„Žt see the bounds used either,2/22/17,1
lossyrob,what_„Žs the method of stitching them?,2/22/17,1
prahim,hmm so what is making it misalign?,2/22/17,1
prahim,"```tiles:  Seq[(SpatialKey, Tile)] with Metadata[M] =???crs: CRS = ???val extent = tiles.metadata.getComponent[Extent]val stitchedTile = tiles.stitch stitchedTile        .crop(extent)        .reproject(tiles.metadata.getComponent[CRS], crs)        .tile```",2/22/17,1
prahim,`stitchedTile.extent` does not match `extent` here,2/22/17,1
lossyrob,"that would make sense, if nodata tiles that are accounted for in metadata.extent would be removed, the stitch calculates some true extent of the tiles",2/22/17,1
lossyrob,so I would sort of expect that to work,2/22/17,1
lossyrob,what do you mean by misaligned?,2/22/17,1
prahim,like the stitched image doesn't fit in the extent provided -- it is out of place,2/22/17,1
lossyrob,what extent provided?,2/22/17,1
prahim,the extent returned is `extent` above and the image is `stitchedTile` and when put on a map it doesn't look correct,2/22/17,1
prahim,"but when nodata tiles are not filtered out, it works fine",2/22/17,1
lossyrob,yeah they will not be the same,2/22/17,1
lossyrob,because you are removing data,2/22/17,1
lossyrob,so the stitched extent is going to reflect the actual data there,2/22/17,1
prahim,but I am removing nodata data why does the extent of the data change?,2/22/17,1
lossyrob,because those data tiles are gone,2/22/17,1
lossyrob,so the layer extent is not the extent of the data that is acutally data,2/22/17,1
lossyrob,it_„Žs the extent of the raster that was incoming before tileToLayout was called,2/22/17,1
lossyrob,it doesn_„Žt go in and check if border pixels are NoData,2/22/17,1
prahim,"okay so the extent is just the envelope of the tiles regardless of whether the tiles contain ""data""",2/22/17,1
prahim,"Is there a better way than calculating min and max spatial keys after filtering and calling```            val newMetadata = filteredTiles.metadata.updateBounds(              Bounds(minSpatialKey, maxSpatialKey)            )```to update the metadata before writing? ",2/22/17,1
prahim,I saw functions to generate metadata `fromRDD` but I have implicit errors,2/22/17,1
lossyrob,"well, the extent isn_„Žt just of the tiles. It_„Žs of the original rasters. So if you read in a set of geotiffs to ingest, it computes the bounding box of the whole set. That_„Žs the extent (after any reprojection). It might not fit exactly the tile boundaries. But it also doesn_„Žt account for NoData values (and sparse rasters for that matter, it just is one bounding box that holds all of your original raster data)",2/22/17,1
lossyrob,are you doing this filter on the ingest side?,2/22/17,1
lossyrob,thinking of if there_„Žs a way to do it earlier,2/22/17,1
lossyrob,"there_„Žs actually not, which is a bit unfortunate",2/22/17,1
prahim,"hmm okay ... yea ingest side .. so I tried```val sourceTiles: RDD[(ProjectedExtent, Tile)] =            sc.parallelize(Seq(layer.location))              .map(fetchGeoTiff(_))              .map { geoTiff =>                val reprojected: Raster[Tile] = geoTiff.raster.reproject(geoTiff.crs, WebMercator, Bilinear)                val projectedExtent = ProjectedExtent(reprojected.extent, WebMercator)                (projectedExtent, reprojected.tile)              }          val filteredSourceTiles = sourceTiles.filter(!_._2.isNoDataTile)geotrellis.spark.ingest.Ingest[ProjectedExtent, SpatialKey](            filteredSourceTiles,            ... ) { (tileLayerRdd, zoom) =>```to your point to do it earlier but it didn't filter anything out ... could you help me understand why",2/22/17,1
lossyrob,"so you would compute the new bounds, and then you could use the `mapTransform` on the GridBounds of those keys to update the extent",2/22/17,1
lossyrob,"that filter step, would filter out only if the entire geotiff is nodata",2/22/17,1
lossyrob,which isn_„Žt the case,2/22/17,1
lossyrob,"it_„Žs when you split the tiles into tiles that fit into the grid layout, that you end up with nodata tiles",2/22/17,1
lossyrob,so you have to filter after you_„Žve cut the tiles,2/22/17,1
prahim,ah okay,2/22/17,1
lossyrob,but then the metadata becomes wrong,2/22/17,1
lossyrob,so you have to recreate it,2/22/17,1
lossyrob,which is wonky. I wish we had a cut tiles method that would take this into account,2/22/17,1
prahim,yes please ,2/22/17,1
lossyrob,:),2/22/17,1
prahim,right now I am calculating the min and max spatial keys and then creating the new bounds and calling updateBounds on the metadata which ends up calling mapTransform(GridBounds),2/22/17,1
lossyrob,oh. right then that should work,2/22/17,1
prahim,okay then I think the point I was missing was what the extent really is .. now it makes sense,2/22/17,1
lossyrob,:+1: ,2/22/17,1

lossyrob,no prob! thanks for working that out here,2/22/17,1

karalas,ah ok thanks!,2/24/17,1
pomadchin,to make it work set [this](https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis-chatta-demo/blob/master/geotrellis/src/main/resources/application.conf#L6) parameter to `true`,2/24/17,1
karalas,"@pomadchin  If I remove all mentions of masking, there still exists in ```ChattaServiceRouter.scala``` ```bytes``` val as an input of ```HttpResponse``` . What can I do in order ```bytes``` not to be depended  on ```maskedTile```? I am sorry for this kind of questions, but I am really struggling to understand.. Thanks ",2/24/17,1
pomadchin,@karalas show me the line you are talking about,2/24/17,1
dorukozturk,is it possible to use the spark-etl assembly and udpate a layer?,2/24/17,1
acoronadoiruegas,"Greetings to all, I have a multiband layer, where one of the bands corresponds to the land use class, I want to generate rectangles of 100 x 100 pixels. Where all pixels are of the same class. I think focalMean can serve, but you guys recommend me? Subsequently generate statistics of each region, but the main problem is to generate this list of homogeneous rectangles (or indexes to the rectangles). Of course there is no problem if there is overlap between the rectangles. That's why I think a local operation, like FocalMean, with a 100 x 100 neighborhood could be useful. Thanks",2/24/17,1
pomadchin,"@dorukozturk yo, nope, that would be supported in future releases ): you have to write code yourself ",2/24/17,1
acoronadoiruegas,"What I mean, only come to my mind solutions, which seem inefficient, due to my ignorance of geotrellis. For example, extract only the class of my interest, say class 38, and only where there is such a value there will be data, in the rest will be NODATA, then I apply FocalMean of a neighborhood of 100 x 100 and in all those pixels where there is a value exactly Equal to 38, these will be the centers of the desired regions, there will be multiple contiguous centers, but that is not a problem at all. But it seems to me somewhat inefficient.",2/24/17,1
Sharathmk99,"Hi All. I have problem statement like, there is 50GB image data from Drone and I want to stitch the images.. Can I use ODM for this? If yes, please suggest system configuration and can I leverage GPU for processing??. Please help......",2/25/17,1
dorukozturk,Do you guys have documentation on submitting large ingest jobs and best practices? I saw that using gdal_retile helps with parallelizing the process more. Are there any other tricks like that? I understand this configs vary based on the cluster and the size/format of the dataset. I am curious about tuning my application. For example numPartitions and partitions how do they differ and how do you set them? Should you use 100000 or 10 or 100? Or this is kind of a spark question more than a geotrellis question :),2/25/17,1

metasim,@echeipesh @pomadchin @lossyrob  :-D ,2/25/17,1
lossyrob,"@acoronadoiruegas I_„Žm having trouble figuring out your exact problem. You want to, for each cell, generate a 100x100 area? Or you want to generate, for each pixel, the mean value of only values that are of a certain classification?",2/26/17,1
lossyrob,"@Sharathmk99 If you have raw drone imagery that needs to be stitched and orthorectified, ODM is a good tool for that. They would be the best people to ask, as I haven_„Žt used ODM enough to be able to help. If you_„Žre looking to mosiac or deal with the GeoTiffs that would come out of something like ODM, we_„Žd be able to help with that",2/26/17,1
lossyrob,@dorukozturk we actually don_„Žt need gdal_retile anymore with the release of 1.0_„_we can use the `maxTileSize` option in ETL (and the winowed GeoTiff reading functionality) to just do what gdal_retile was doing for us on the fly during the ingest.,2/26/17,1
lossyrob,"As for the partition size thing: you_„Žre hitting on a very important part of running ingest jobs. I do believe it_„Žs sort of a general spark thing, but something that we deal with a lot",2/26/17,1
lossyrob,"how many cores, how much memory per executor? How many partitions? These are generally the questions we end up trying to answer, and it often takes some trial and error",2/26/17,1
lossyrob,I take the landsat EMR demo config as a general guideline when dealing with EC2 instances,2/26/17,1
lossyrob,https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis-landsat-emr-demo/blob/master/config-ingest.mk#L8-L12,2/26/17,1
lossyrob,and set partitions by the size of the job,2/26/17,1
lossyrob,"I_„Žve had to set 50K partitions before, often times less",2/26/17,1
lossyrob,"if you describe the job, I can probably try to think of what I would do, and explain my logic",2/26/17,1
lossyrob,@metasim :tada: :tada:,2/26/17,1
karalas,@pomadchin  https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis-chatta-demo/blob/master/geotrellis/src/main/scala/geotrellis/chatta/ChattaServiceRouter.scala#L194,2/26/17,1
dorukozturk,@lossyrob Thanks for your clarification. So here is our use case: We have 8000 single band spatial files (sizes vary from 100 mb to 1 gb) and the total size is ~1.5 tb. We want to ingest them to an s3 catalog (we read from s3 as well). For the cluster we do not really have a limit. We actually want to run this job in hours not days :). That is the only limit. Like if we can ingest it in 8-10 hours that will be perfect. Is it enough to just provide maxTileSize on the input.json or do I need to change something on the etl project? My other question is about the cluster. So when I launch a 8 node cluster equipped with 16 cores each I get a lot of cores but only 9 of them were used despite almost all the memory were used during the ingest. Is that normal? I am guessing usage of all the memory is good but using only 10 percent of the cores seemed wrong to me. It would be fantastic if you can share set of configs that you use during an ingest similar to mine. ,2/26/17,1
lossyrob,What's the instance type? Your on aws right? Are you running EMR?,2/26/17,1
lossyrob,What's your current executor config for memory and cores? ,2/26/17,1
Sharathmk99,@lossyrob Thank you very much for the information.,2/26/17,1
dorukozturk,"@lossyrob i am on emr, i ran a cluster of 8 nodes with m3 2xlarge instances and i set my executor memory to 20g and cores to 16 which was the max of the machines. I am planning around 50 or 100 nodes to do the ingest",2/26/17,1
lossyrob,We use the same instances,2/26/17,1
lossyrob,"The key is the executor memory and cores. If the executors ask for too much mem, YARN won_„Žt allocate as much of them on the machine as you_„Žd like",2/26/17,1
lossyrob,"By using executors with 2 cores, memory set to 4200M, and yarn overhead to 700M, you should be able to see most of the CPUs get utilized",2/26/17,1
lossyrob,"that should work out no matter what the # of nodes in your cluster are. If it doesn_„Žt, either you_„Žll end up with YARN killing your containers because they take up too much mem - in which case you should push up the # of partitions (in which case you have to push up the memory, and eat the lack of CPU power), or if the # of containers isn_„Žt expected, in which you have to push down the memory to get more containers allocated",2/26/17,1
dorukozturk,ok that is very useful. Thank you very much.,2/27/17,1
lossyrob,"you should definitly use the `maxTileSize` option (https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/blob/master/spark-etl/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/etl/config/Input.scala#L32, in Input JSON https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/blob/master/docs/guide/etl.rst#input-json) and set to something like 1024",2/27/17,1
lossyrob,then repartition to something like 15K to start (that_„Žs a guess),2/27/17,1
lossyrob,"the way I do partition is, rule of thumb, you want your tasks to execute in around 500ms",2/27/17,1
lossyrob,that comes from databricks,2/27/17,1
lossyrob,"so if your seeing something like 5s, 10s task execution, you need to bump the partitions up",2/27/17,1
lossyrob,"sometimes I can_„Žt get it to 500ms, and that_„Žs OK, just a rule of thumb. Sometimes it only gets to 1 or 2 sec",2/27/17,1
dorukozturk,"ok, that is very informative. What about the size of the cluster? Are there guidelines like ( I am just making up) if your total data is 500 G you need at least 100 G of ram or something like that?",2/27/17,1
lossyrob,"if you partition it right, then the size of the cluster only dictates speed",2/27/17,1
lossyrob,"because it_„Žs a matter of, can the cluster work on 100 partitions at a time or 1000",2/27/17,1
lossyrob,i.e. a job that can is configured correctly should be able to run on 3 nodes along with 300 nodes in the same config,2/27/17,1
dorukozturk,I see. And you said it is good if each task is around 500ms and you see that on the spark ui?,2/27/17,1
lossyrob,"Yup. If you go click into a job, into a stage, you_„Žll get some statistics on min max and average task execution time",2/27/17,1
lossyrob,so I aim for the average to be 500ms,2/27/17,1
lossyrob,"oftentimes it_„Žs more like 1s, but that_„Žs what I go for at least",2/27/17,1
lossyrob,one important thing to note,2/27/17,1
lossyrob,"when you make many tasks, say like 50K",2/27/17,1
lossyrob,or above,2/27/17,1
lossyrob,you start to put a whole lot of pressure on the memory of the driver,2/27/17,1
lossyrob,because it has to track the DAG and all the tasks and everything,2/27/17,1
lossyrob,"and when the driver runs out of memory, it_„Žs a really weird and hard to parse error in YARN",2/27/17,1
lossyrob,so for large jobs I_„Žll usually just make the master node a m3.2xlarge and give it a heap full of memory,2/27/17,1
dorukozturk,"cool, when I specify numpartitions and maxtilesize I got this: geotrellis.raster.io.geotiff.reader.MalformedGeoTiffException: incorrect byte order",2/27/17,1
lossyrob,that happens when it tries to read a non-geotiff as a geotiff. ,2/27/17,1
lossyrob,so is there a file it could be trying to read in the input directory that_„Žs not a geotiff,2/27/17,1
dorukozturk,yes that is the case ,2/27/17,1
lossyrob,That_„Žs actually a bug in here: https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/blob/master/s3/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/io/s3/TiffTagsS3InputFormat.scala#L27. More like a missing feature. That should be using the tiff tag extensions to filter out non-tiff files,2/27/17,1
lossyrob,here is where it is used,2/27/17,1
lossyrob,https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/blob/master/s3/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/io/s3/S3GeoTiffRDD.scala#L107-L112,2/27/17,1
lossyrob,"I_„Žll write up an issue, unless you want to do the honors :)",2/27/17,1
dorukozturk,sure I will be happy to :) ,2/27/17,1
lossyrob,thanks!,2/27/17,1
lossyrob,"as far as a temp workaround, I don_„Žt know if you would be able to get rid of those files. or else you could just make the change in a local geotrellis clone and publish local (and then a PR would be handy)",2/27/17,1
lossyrob,basically have to mimic what happens here:https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/blob/master/s3/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/io/s3/S3InputFormat.scala#L61-L67,2/27/17,1
dorukozturk,cool tomorrow first job I ll try. (Probably early morning) ,2/27/17,1
lossyrob,ah actually,2/27/17,1
lossyrob,I might be mistaken,2/27/17,1
lossyrob,yeah,2/27/17,1
lossyrob,because it_„Žs an S3InputFormat,2/27/17,1
lossyrob,that should just happen for the TiffTagS3InputFormat,2/27/17,1
lossyrob,so that_„Žs actually not the solution. hmm_„_.,2/27/17,1
lossyrob,should filter on the extensions listed here https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/blob/master/s3/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/io/s3/S3GeoTiffRDD.scala#L59,2/27/17,1
lossyrob,my bad,2/27/17,1
lossyrob,sometimes things get weird if you don_„Žt end your _„ñdirectory_„ keys with a `/`,2/27/17,1
lossyrob,so for example sending in prefix=`some/dir/of/files` instead of `some/dir/of/files/`,2/27/17,1
lossyrob,should try the latter,2/27/17,1
pomadchin,@karalas [here](https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis-chatta-demo/blob/master/geotrellis/src/main/scala/geotrellis/chatta/ChattaServiceRouter.scala#L190) use `tile` instead of `maskedTile`,2/27/17,1

pomadchin,can you point me? or you just build geotrellis-etl assembly,2/27/17,1

dorukozturk,ok when I did not pass maxTileSize it started to run,2/27/17,1
lossyrob,Interesting. Could be a bug in the window reader. Looks like it's trying to read a buye,2/27/17,1
lossyrob,*byte range that doesn't exist,2/27/17,1
dorukozturk,"when I did not use maxtilesize I got this  User class threw exception: org.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted due to stage failure: Task 63 in stage 0.0 failed 4 times, most recent failure: Lost task 63.3 in stage 0.0 (TID 83, ip-172-31-46-228.us-west-2.compute.internal): ExecutorLostFailure (executor 42 exited caused by one of the running tasks) Reason: Container marked as failed: container_1488202636886_0006_01_000925 on host: ip-172-31-46-228.us-west-2.compute.internal.

dorukozturk,does that mean the cluster is not beefy enough ?,2/27/17,1
dorukozturk,it has 10 m3 2xlarge worker nodes,2/27/17,1
lossyrob,Container being killed never have to do with the size of the cluster. Only to do with container (executor) configuration,2/27/17,1

pomadchin,it_„Žs normal,2/28/17,1

karalas,"and read then for example the ```SpatialKey(x,y)```",2/28/17,1
pomadchin,"ah ._. so the problem of these lines: you have a set of tiffs you want to ingest, right? and all tiffs have own geospatial reference; duting the ingest process app grabs all the input tifs, cut them into tiles into some layout and assignes SpatialKey to each chunk (tile) on a certain zoom level; that means that there can be missing keys",2/28/17,1

metasim,(i.e. when we're not doing `spark-submit`),3/1/17,1
pomadchin,when you don't use spark-submit than you need to provide binaries of version you prefer,3/1/17,1

dorukozturk,"@grisha I want to ""append"" to an already ingested layer. I am using the spark-etl assembly and I see that I need a layer updater. My dataset is global which consists of (8000 files). I see that you have this example(https://gist.github.com/pomadchin/c2c8346ab0ef1ece11cf4432a87d14ec#file-layerupdatersample-scala-L70-L71) my question is since my layer is global can I preset somehow the attribute store and do not deal with updater? So simply can I have 8000 layers on s3 jam all the data on the zoom levels to the same layer and somehow create my json files (I am literally thinking about rysnc)? Since my layer is global the extent should not be a problem right? My question is can I  create the json metadata files by hand (programmatically but not with geotrellis) for a global layer?",3/3/17,1
pomadchin,"@dorukozturk hm, what do you mean by not to deal with layer updater?",3/3/17,1
pomadchin,"can you expand a bit, what_„Žs your idea? o: i just don_„Žt really get what you are trying to do; but ofc, you can preset your attr store, and it_„Žs done with layer writer // as you don_„Žt have a layer in your attr store before write",3/3/17,1
lossyrob,@dorukozturk the issue there is with the SFC index,3/3/17,1
lossyrob,"each S3 file name is based on the space filling curve index, which plays into the index configuration in the metadata",3/3/17,1
lossyrob,so you_„Žd have to name every tile appropriately,3/3/17,1
lossyrob,"but can it be done? It could, but it might end up being more difficult",3/3/17,1
lossyrob,What are the things your trying to avoid/problems your having/optimizations your thinking of?,3/3/17,1
dorukozturk,So i have 8000 files and i want to visualize them all. As far as i understand i can either give the s3 bucket path which holds all my tiffs or i can just add have a layer and keep updating it iteratively. Let me ask it this way: can a reader read from the catalog without the layer id? If i have 8000 layers as opposed to 1 layers with 8000 files in it in my catalog can i read them all with a boundary query? I want to ingest my layers one by one and show them all at once:),3/3/17,1
lossyrob,Do the 8000 files overlap?,3/3/17,1
lossyrob,The way to do that would be  inside a tile server,3/3/17,1
lossyrob,"so say you have 8000 layers, 8000 layer IDs",3/3/17,1
lossyrob,"in this tile server that you would code up, I_„Žd have a structure that related (in memory cache) which layer IDs covered which `z/x/y` tiles",3/3/17,1
lossyrob,"so that per tile request, I can look up which layers I would need to read from",3/3/17,1
lossyrob,"then, pull down the appropriate tiles, mosaic them if needed, color correct, a la all the stuff that Raster Foundry does, and then put it on a map",3/3/17,1
lossyrob,so definitely possible ,3/3/17,1
lossyrob,but requires more coding in the tile server. which is probably where you want to do a lot of the work anyway,3/3/17,1
dorukozturk,Sure so having 8000 ids wont be a problem? And do you have an example for asking only the tiles in the viewport?,3/3/17,1
lossyrob,"Raster Foundry does it, so I_„Žd say look into that code: https://github.com/azavea/raster-foundry/blob/develop/app-backend/tile/src/main/scala/routes/MosaicRoutes.scala",3/3/17,1
lossyrob,"but it does a whole lot of other things, so it might be hard to parse just that out of the code.",3/3/17,1
dorukozturk,I double checked so my layers do not overlap that means I do not have to deal with mosaicing right?,3/3/17,1
dorukozturk,I just need z/x/y to layer name somehow,3/3/17,1
lossyrob,yeah,3/3/17,1
lossyrob,which isn_„Žt too difficult - each of the layer metadata will have the grid bounds of the layer,3/3/17,1
lossyrob,https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/TileLayerMetadata.scala#L49,3/3/17,1
lossyrob,I_„Žd actually just read the extent,3/3/17,1
lossyrob,and you can compute the grid bounds for each zoom level,3/3/17,1
lossyrob,"maybe event compute the 8000 extents once, run through all the layers and gather layer name to extent, save that off in a JSON file somewhere",3/3/17,1
lossyrob,"then on tile server start up, read that in, compute the grid bounds (statically or on the fly per tile request)",3/3/17,1
lossyrob,"`LayerList.layerFor(zoom, x, y): LayerId` something like that",3/3/17,1

dorukozturk,I ingested lot of layers. In the catalog I have 7000 layer ids. I am trying to write the tile server to visualize them based on the viewport of the map. So each time user pans and zooms I am doing an intersection between all 7000 layers and the viewport of the map. So getIntersectingLayers is returning an Array of Layerid's each time the user pans and zooms. ,3/6/17,1
dorukozturk,I am trying to visualize multiple layers at a time ultimately,3/6/17,1
dorukozturk,and my layers don't overlap so I did not do a mosaic,3/6/17,1
lossyrob,I think I get the premise,3/6/17,1
lossyrob,"And actually if we think on a type level, we can forget the details and work at that level",3/6/17,1
lossyrob,well first question,3/6/17,1
lossyrob,hm,3/6/17,1
lossyrob,why are you using a hard coded extent?,3/6/17,1
dorukozturk,just for testing ultimately it will be dynamic and will be passed with url,3/6/17,1
lossyrob,"what you really want in this tile route (which serves an individual tile based on `z`, `x` and `y`) is the extent of the tile",3/6/17,1
lossyrob,"not the extent of, say, the viewport",3/6/17,1
lossyrob,"because this endpoint gets hit with the purpose of serving out one tile. So at the time of the request, we only care about the exent of the one tile. right?",3/6/17,1
dorukozturk,yes,3/6/17,1
lossyrob,@jmelching I think the problem would arise from this notion: `This code relies on the input being spatially sorted. In order to get any benefit` that @jamesmcclain. @jamesmcclain what_„Žs the process of spatially sorting them before the vector join?,3/6/17,1
jamesmcclain,"Rather than saying ""sorted"" I should have said that it at least needs to be ""quasi-sorted""",3/6/17,1
lossyrob,"@dorukozturk ok, so we need to figure that part out, but we can just stub that as `def getExtentForTile(z: Int, x: Int, y: Int): Extent`",3/6/17,1
jamesmcclain,"Essentially, the less ""void space"" there is in each partition, the better",3/6/17,1
lossyrob,"right, so how do you achieve that?",3/6/17,1
jamesmcclain,Sorting is one way,3/6/17,1
jamesmcclain,"Some kind of hashing scheme would probably work, as well",3/6/17,1
lossyrob,"@dorukozturk then the next thing is calling that layer funciton. If we are only giving it the tile extent, and there is only one layer that should feed that tile, then it should just be one layer",3/6/17,1
lossyrob,"@jamesmcclain ok, the fact that we don_„Žt provide that functionality to make the vector join useful is a little troubling",3/6/17,1
jamesmcclain,Okay,3/6/17,1
lossyrob,we should try to come up with an example or ways to do an efficient vector join even if the rdds are not pre sorted or pre spatially partitioned,3/6/17,1
lossyrob,"we might already have code to do that, @echeipesh we can partition spatially according to some grid layout right?",3/6/17,1
lossyrob,"@dorukozturk but the thing is, even though the images may not be overlapping, two or more could overlap one tile - e.g. one layer might contribute the left upper corner, and the rest NoData, and another layer could contribute to the right lower corner, with the rest nodata",3/6/17,1
lossyrob,so you actually will end up having to merge,3/6/17,1
lossyrob,"even if that merge doesn_„Žt have to make a choice between two _„ƒdata_„Ž pixels, and only fills in nodata pixels with imagery that contributes those pixels",3/6/17,1
dorukozturk,but zoom level 1 will merge 8000 layers then,3/6/17,1
dorukozturk,wouldn't that be horrible performance wise?,3/6/17,1
lossyrob,di you pyramid your layers?,3/6/17,1
dorukozturk,yepp,3/6/17,1
dorukozturk,0-13,3/6/17,1
lossyrob,"that_„Žs a good point, and you_„Žd have to work around that",3/6/17,1
lossyrob,that_„Žs why having them all as one layer would be best I guess...,3/6/17,1
lossyrob,hmm,3/6/17,1
dorukozturk,:) I tried and failed doing that so I ingested them one by one :D,3/6/17,1
lossyrob,a crazy idea would be to do another _„ƒetl_„Ž that would union the layers all together and then save off/pyramid as the combined layer,3/6/17,1
dorukozturk,depends on how crazy :D,3/6/17,1
lossyrob,I don_„Žt think it should be really. You_„Žd just load up all the RDDs and then do `sc.union`,3/6/17,1
lossyrob,it_„Žs curious that the ingest hung like it did. I wish we could have worked past that - the idea of ingesting 8K of geotiffs is well within the bounds of regular GeoTrellis work,3/6/17,1
dorukozturk,I think the problem is with the windowed read from s3,3/6/17,1
dorukozturk,because the hang happened when I specify maxtilesize,3/6/17,1
lossyrob,"and then otherwise, you would get out of memory?",3/6/17,1
lossyrob,without maxtilesize?,3/6/17,1
dorukozturk,I did not try with all 8000 because when I did not specify maxtilesize It was kind of serial,3/6/17,1
dorukozturk,it was using very little ram,3/6/17,1
lossyrob,there_„Žs other techniques to get around that,3/6/17,1
dorukozturk,I was using like 10% of the cluster memory so I killed it launched 50 small clusters and do the ingest one by one,3/6/17,1
lossyrob,like `split` and `repartition`,3/6/17,1
dorukozturk,we have a demo coming so I was just trying to make it work :D,3/6/17,1
lossyrob,gotcha gotcha,3/6/17,1
lossyrob,I understand that feeling :),3/6/17,1
dorukozturk,"yeah I am very stressed out, our dataa is 1.5 tb",3/6/17,1

pomadchin,@karalas can you post your code somewhere; as it_„Žs a bit hard to debug it this way ^^',3/8/17,1

pomadchin,Yo @Charmatzis what_„Žs the problem? be careful with type constrains this function [has](https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/blob/5513313c543e3dff408b508ed9301f1f1cc24f26/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/pyramid/Pyramid.scala#L44-L52),3/9/17,1
pomadchin,mostly im talking about rather serious limitation in `V` type usge: `V <: CellGrid`,3/9/17,1
Charmatzis,I really can't understand how can I use `LayoutDefinition` and `TileLayout` so it wil be the same as in WebMercator TMS,3/9/17,1
Charmatzis,if I use ,3/9/17,1
Charmatzis,"``` val layoutMap: Map[Int, LayoutDefinition] =      (1 to 20)        .map { case zoom => (zoom, ZoomedLayoutScheme(WebMercator, 512).levelForZoom(zoom).layout) }        .toMap```",3/9/17,1
Charmatzis,I get for each zoom level the right LayoutDefinition in WebMercator,3/9/17,1

dorukozturk,"hi, my ingest job failed here flatMap at CutTiles.scala:46",3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,and it got stuck again :),3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,have you guys encountered an error on this step before?,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,did any tasks get completed? how many tasks? over the whole 8000?,3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,yes over the whole 8000 I am using 1000000 partitions and it got stuck on 122638,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,I would perhaps recommend using `spark.rdd.compress = true` ,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,do you have the UI up?,3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,not anymore :) ,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,"for the stage it is caught on, there were tasks that were completed for that stage?",3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,I submitted the job again though on a new cluster because I was giving only 15G to the worker nodes and I suspected the shuffle write filled out the space in the worker node,3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,yepp 122638/1000000 was done,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,"ah, yes - did any of the nodes go down or did they get stuck in active? You can see in the hdfs UI of decommissioned nodes, or in the YARN ui, or seeing dead executors",3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,yes some nodes died,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,ok. yeah that sounds like hard disk filled up,3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,so I bumped up the space on each worker node,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,cool,3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,I was able to ingest 1000 though :),3/9/17,1
lossyrob,shouldn_„Žt you get a lot of emphermal storage with your instance though?,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,that_„Žs encouraging ,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,curious about how large the largest shuffle write in the job is,3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,at that point it was 3 G,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,when the whole job completes :),3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,"oh I can provide statistics, I am running on a cluster with 190 nodes",3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,4 TB of ram,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,nice,3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,"if it stucks this time I will wait for your response this time, so I can provide info",3/9/17,1
lossyrob,"so in the spark UI, eventually (perhaps after cut tiles) there will be  a shuffle write size, which represents the actual size of the job (you can_„Žt really know with the compressed file total size)",3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,sure so for example the stage 0 is repartition and total is 485.5 mb,3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,so no matter how I partitioned reduce at TileLayerMetadata.scala:147 step takes 2 hours,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,"there_„Žs not really a shuffle at the start, so you won_„Žt see the large shuffle write until later tiles. If you_„Žre using buffered reproject, the largest shuffle will probably be that",3/9/17,1
lossyrob,interesting that takes 2 hours,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,"there_„Žs a tweak that should make that a lot faster, at least that step",3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,what is the tweak ?,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,to use TiffTags to construct the metadata,3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,but that requires preprocessing and adding the correct tifftags?,3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,or tools like gdalwarp already adds them,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,"the tags are there, it_„Žs just the metadata extraction doesn_„Žt use the streaming stuff to pull only the tag data right now",3/9/17,1
lossyrob,"it reads the images in order to get metadata, which is wasteful",3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,I see,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,what method are you using for ETL? are you calling etl.load?,3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,yepp,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,"well I_„Žll think through that, but will take a bit to produce something",3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,"ok, sounds good ",3/9/17,1
lossyrob,@Charmatzis when you say Y is wrong - you mean the tile coordinates (SpatialKeys)?,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,"could this be an issue where (x, y) = (lng, lat) vs lat long are getting mixedu p",3/9/17,1
lossyrob,"@acoronadoiruegas for Tiles, this would be a good example to follow off of https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/blob/master/raster/src/main/scala/geotrellis/raster/mapalgebra/focal/Max.scala#L28",3/9/17,1
lossyrob,feel free to ask questions about the architecture,3/9/17,1

dorukozturk,after increasing disk space it looks like it is going through and based on my quick estimation it will shuffle write ~600 GB,3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,for the cuttiles step,3/9/17,1
pomadchin,do you use EMR?,3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,yepp,3/9/17,1
pomadchin,you can use ganglia to monitor physical nodes resources,3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,"himm before disk space each node was low and nodes were dying in the cuttiles method I bumped it to 250 GB each node so now I passed the step that it was failing so I  just wanted to share, maybe somebody in the future will be scraping this gitter conversations :D ",3/9/17,1
lossyrob,ha yes. Perhaps a post-mortem after it works would be really useful to that future person :),3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,"I will definitely do that,",3/9/17,1

lossyrob,"there_„Žs no fingers crossed emoji, but I feel like it_„Žs appropriate here",3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,ok it looks like it froze again at cuttiles,3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,and I have the ui opened,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,are nodes dying again?,3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,some executors have this CANNOT FIND ADDRESS,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,"one thing to check is the hadoop UI, which can tell you how much DFS and non-DFS space is used",3/9/17,1

lossyrob,what_„Žs the instance type again?,3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,m4 2xlarge,3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,so the total shuffle write is 176.3 GB at this point,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,"those are EBS only, with m3.2xlarge you get 160x2 SSDs",3/9/17,1
lossyrob,you gave it what sort of volume?,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,what size ebs?,3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,"[{VolumeSpecification={VolumeType=gp2,SizeInGB=250},VolumesPerInstance=1}",3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,both the master and workeers have 250GB,3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,and 41 of the cuttiles failed,3/9/17,1
pomadchin,i had experience when spark just ate all disk space; nodes were just killed sielntly and emr tried to bootstrap new; ._. that_„Žs why everything hanged,3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,so before when I refresh the number was changing all the time and it is stuck now,3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,number of finished task I am not being impatient right?,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,nah you want to always see forward progress,3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,so should I bump them to 1TB or something you think it is a matter of that? Or should I increase the worker memory from 4200 to 8GB maybe and reduce partitions?,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,thinking,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,you really shouldn_„Žt be running out of disk space if it_„Žs that much space,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,you have how many nodes running?,3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,190,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,that_„Žs 47 TB,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,something else is going on,3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,so this is the highest shuffle spill (memory) 5.2,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,can you imgur the UI?,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,for the stages,3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,http://imgur.com/a/vH7HI,3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,maxtilesize is 512 will using 256 reduce shuffle size if that is all about shuffle size? My guts tell me to either use 256 as maxtilesize or bump the memory per executor and drop partitions just to see but if you think that is irrelevant than I really don't know,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,I don_„Žt think it_„Žs the shuffle size,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,I_„Žve done way more on way smaller clusters,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,it might be the 1mil tasks,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,is there a way to check the stats of the master node?,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,ah actually not the master,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,the driver,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,"so the executors tab should have the driver on there, and the logs should maybe indicate it_„Žs health",3/9/17,1

dorukozturk,anything odd here?,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,no,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,so executors are dying? is there any error messages you can track down for why the executors are dying?,3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,there are 28 dead executors,3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,I will try to see their logs,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,"sometimes the master logs (which you can get through via the YARN ui, hit the application link at the left of the table, look at logs there) are good to look at. I think they might be the same as the logs that you can get at via the driver logs via the executor list",3/9/17,1
lossyrob,how many partitions did you use for the 1000 files?,3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,100,3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,this log is huge,3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,:D,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,maybe bringing the partition count down to 500K,3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,ok I can give that a try,3/9/17,1
dorukozturk,should I play with the maxtilesize or executor memory u think?,3/9/17,1
lossyrob,"I don_„Žt think you should have to - I was running on those files with that setup, and so it should just be a matter of scaling",3/9/17,1

lossyrob,@Charmatzis the reproject on `TileLayerRDD[SpatialKey]` should reproject the spatial keys (i.e. put the keys into the new key space) - it does a reproject of the tiles and then cuts those resulting rasters into the new layout scheme,3/10/17,1
lossyrob,"re: if I use ``` val layoutMap: Map[Int, LayoutDefinition] =      (1 to 20)        .map { case zoom => (zoom, ZoomedLayoutScheme(WebMercator, 512).levelForZoom(zoom).layout) }        .toMap```I get for each zoom level the right LayoutDefinition in WebMercatorIs that right?",3/10/17,1

dorukozturk,and level 8 and level 7 has same number of tiles which is suspicios :),3/13/17,1
dorukozturk,level 8 has 7876 tiles level 7 should have ~7876/4 right?,3/13/17,1
echeipesh,"`Pyramid.levelStream(layer, layoutScheme, lastZoom-1, 7))` that seems very suspitious, what are you trying to do there ?",3/13/17,1
echeipesh,Why `lastZoom-1` ?,3/13/17,1
dorukozturk,when I used lastZoom (which means last zoom level I have) It told me I have zoom level 8 already,3/13/17,1
dorukozturk,so I started that from 7 is that wrong :),3/13/17,1
echeipesh,"Yeah, you_„Žre giving it level at zoom 8, telling it its zoom level 7 and asking it to pyramid to 7, at which poing it goes _„ñGreat! Job done!_„ https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/pyramid/Pyramid.scala#L140",3/13/17,1
echeipesh,"So you don_„Žt want to save 8, because you already have it, this should do the trick: `Pyramid.levelStream(layer, layoutScheme, lastZoom, 7)).tail` - that will drop the intial, zoom 8, layer since you already have it.",3/13/17,1

echeipesh,did you add the `.tail` to outoupt of `levelStream` ?,3/13/17,1
dorukozturk,ok quick question isn't .tail the same thing as starting from zoomlevel -1 ?,3/13/17,1
echeipesh,Nope. Each item in the sequence undergoes a pyramid transformation. When you lie about zoom level it skips the transformation which is why zoom level 7 looks exactly like zoom level 8.,3/13/17,1
echeipesh,"The shift on the map is because leaflet is using the layout for zoom level 7 but in reality its just fetching tiles from zoom level 8, which probably means the raster got visually moved toward south-west corner.",3/13/17,1

kthompson,yea exactly,3/14/17,1
kthompson,like the `_links` fields for example,3/14/17,1

lossyrob,It_„Žs possible to lean on GeoTrellis JsonFormats while writing JsonFormats for container objects,3/14/17,1
kthompson,or the `properties` bit. Yea I am not sure if these are legit extensions for geojson either ,3/14/17,1
lossyrob,"so to parse out the geometry, you can just use the GeoTrellis stuff",3/14/17,1

kthompson,oh nice,3/14/17,1
lossyrob,"so you end up redoing a bit of the Feature format, but for the complicated Geometry stuff you can still lean on GeoTrellis",3/14/17,1
kthompson,that would get me pretty close already just need to pull the `_` fields. Awesome thanks for the tips,3/14/17,1
lossyrob,no problem,3/14/17,1
lossyrob,"I_„Žve thought of making a `geotrellis-planet` or `scala-planet-api` or something similar for interacting with Planet_„Žs API; this would be good code for that, if you feel like putting it in a Gist or sharing it in some way",3/14/17,1

dorukozturk,in geopyspark I am doing a catalog.query() with a polygon . As far as I understand it is returning all the tiles that touches the given polygon. Is there a clip kind of functionality? Or how can I get the extent of the returned rdd to clip the array myself? I see in the returned metadata there are 2 extents but they are not the extents of the returned rdd. ,3/15/17,1
echeipesh,"That_„Žs a good point, query will return intersecting tiles, which will cover larger area than the initial polygon. We haven_„Žt implemented clipping in python yet, but the way it would be handled and is handled in spark is to mask each tile by the query geometry, which will turn all the cells outside the geometry into NODATA.",3/15/17,1
dorukozturk,"himm so there is no easy way of getting the whole extent of the returned rdds? Because if I knew what was returned, even they were big I could have done some rasterio magic and mask the array ",3/15/17,1
echeipesh,"No, there really isn_„Žt. It would be simple enough to calculate that on scala side, but python geopyspark doesn_„Žt really expose that much functionality yet. Do you think this is something that generally be included in query responsose or is this basically a work around for not being able to do clipping in the first place ?",3/15/17,1
dorukozturk,"I think both clipping and intersecting are very handy and they are useful different use cases.  In our case it would be great if we could get back a clipped rdd, extent thing is only for the workaround ",3/15/17,1
echeipesh,"@metasim Sorry to have missed you question, is that still outstanding ?",3/15/17,1
metasim,"NP. I just worked around it by using an `IntColorMap`. I tried debugging it to see why a `ColorRamp` wouldn't work, but to no avail.",3/15/17,1

echeipesh,"Don_„Žt want to send you chasing after shadows, but that value is `0x440154FF` which is the first value in `Viridis` ColorRamp. Kind of weird to be doing lookup by color rather than by value or count, so something smells fishy.",3/15/17,1

pomadchin,w0w,3/16/17,1
pomadchin,"sry mb i'm repeating everything already was written by you, but can you post here the full command you are trying to run?",3/16/17,1
dorukozturk,"@pomadchin ```shspark-submit --master yarn-cluster --verbose --class demo.Main --driver-memory 4200M --driver-cores 2 --executor-memory 4200M --executor-cores 2 --conf spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled=true --conf spark.driver.maxResultSize=4g --conf spark.yarn.executor.memoryOverhead=700 --conf spark.yarn.driver.memoryOverhead=700 s3://kitware-geotrellis-demo/geotrellis-sbt-template-assembly-0.1.0.jar```",3/16/17,1
dorukozturk,Any ideas on my issue ?,3/17/17,1
echeipesh,@dorukozturk I wonder if the `spark.default.parallelism` is too low. If the catalog read does not get `numPartitions` explicitly it uses `SparkContext.defaultParallelism`. You would know if you look at the task execution in the spark web UI and you have low number of partitions in the tasks. Without enough partitions the YARN cluster manager would not be able to scale up the executors with `spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled=true`.,3/17/17,1
echeipesh,@Charmatzis I haven_„Žt run into that problem but I_„Žm pretty sure JTS has no support for geodetic operations and dateline wrapping. Looks from that link like you can unwrap the JTS geoms and work with spatial4j but it wouldn_„Žt be pretty code.,3/17/17,1
metasim,"@Charmatzis FWIW, we just ran into a similar problem reprojecting MODIS data.",3/17/17,1
dorukozturk,@echeipesh Thank you very much I will double check that now.,3/17/17,1
dorukozturk,@echeipesh you were right that was the problem,3/17/17,1
dorukozturk,it was defaulting to 2 somehow :),3/17/17,1
Charmatzis,@metasim and howdid you solved it?,3/17/17,1
pomadchin,@metasim what modis product have you ingested? as i don_„Žt remember probelms with mod09a1 ; interesting (i ingested in native sinusoidal projection on a webmercator layout),3/17/17,1
metasim,"@Charmatzis We switched from ""buffer"" ETL mode to ""per-tile"" and the problem went away. The cause was that when we reprojected the oringinal granule there was enough rounding error to create a tile of zero area (that' my understanding; the work was being done by someone else).",3/17/17,1
metasim,@pomadchin It was [MCD43A4](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/dataset_discovery/modis/modis_products_table/mcd43a4).,3/17/17,1
pomadchin,"@metasim it makes sense, i ingested the same data in times there were no buffered tiles support",3/17/17,1
pomadchin,sounds like a ~bug~ in buffered method?,3/17/17,1
metasim,"We also had to use an (approximate?) ESRI CRS code, as [SR-ORG:6974](http://spatialreference.org/ref/sr-org/6974/) isn't available in GT.... I can't find any info out there on who the authority is on SR-ORG codes. You guys knowanything about it?",3/17/17,1
pomadchin,"@metasim instead of not perfect ETL you can write your own ingest, and geotrellis would be pretty happy with just a correct proj4 string",3/17/17,1
metasim,"Yes, but there's just enough machinery in the ETL stuff to make that a difficult cost/benefit decision for us. #2072 was our hoped-for solution :)",3/17/17,1
metasim,"Would you guys accept a PR on that, or does it open a can of worms somewhere else?",3/17/17,1
pomadchin,that would be a part of https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/issues/1767,3/17/17,1
pomadchin,"but you can create a PR against current ETL, mb that idea would be moved into refactored ETL",3/17/17,1
metasim,"Actually, if my exploration is corret, the code to handle it  is isolated to `CRS.fromName`.",3/17/17,1
metasim,I'm assuming the `backend.json` processing just passes the string through.,3/17/17,1
metasim,(I mean `output.json`),3/17/17,1
pomadchin,that's totaly can and would be done; but in theory you don_„Žt even need to provide output crs if you don_„Žt want to reproject the input source (that_„Žs how it should work),3/17/17,1

Also, images that belong to a neighboring (other) tile, have again a different layer name. Is this how it works, or all images of the same area (satellite tile) can be defined ""under the same folder"" descriminated by different time instances, and another area has its own folder respectively?

pomadchin,btw,3/23/17,1
pomadchin,@kthompson i tried your output,3/23/17,1
pomadchin,it looks ok,3/23/17,1
pomadchin,"where is the bug, mb i just didn_„Žt notice smth?",3/23/17,1
pomadchin,i looked at images using qgis; decided to check gdal and gdalinfo with `-mm` calculation eqals on input and on ouput,3/23/17,1
kthompson,oh really? hrm maybe its an issue with QGIS,3/23/17,1
kthompson,i just updated it ill check the image in the updated version,3/23/17,1
kthompson,ahh screwy it looks like it was QGIS. thanks for the help,3/23/17,1
pomadchin,^^_„Ž),3/23/17,1
echeipesh,"@Charmatzis Thats interesting question. I suppose if the CD raster is small enough (which it probably isn_„Žt) you can just use some existing shortest path library to search over it, treating each pixel as a vertex. If you_„Žre trying to build a shortest path on tiled raster it looks like GraphX has shortest path algorithm, but it would probably do something aweful to job memory requirements to unroll a raster like that.",3/23/17,1
echeipesh,Although if its a single source CD raster you can just greedily choose the next pixel with lowest value and walk the raster to the source that way.,3/23/17,1
Charmatzis,"@echeipesh  wait a second, I believe there a function for that ",3/23/17,1

kthompson,@pomadchin is it possible to to streaming with a compressed geotiff?,3/23/17,1
kthompson,"it looks like when i do `GeoTiffReader.readMultiband(reader, true, true)` it actually downloads the whole geotiff immediately",3/23/17,1
echeipesh,@kthompson This is something that got fixed in 1.1.0-RC1 for multiband streaming: https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/pull/1905,3/23/17,1
kthompson,@echeipesh is that post RC1? or part of RC1?,3/23/17,1
echeipesh,It_„Žs part of RC1,3/23/17,1
kthompson,i *think* there is still an issue. im working on making something to make it reproducable,3/23/17,1
pomadchin,"@kthompson that would be helpful, thank you!",3/23/17,1
kthompson,alright here you go: https://gist.github.com/kthompson/7462b7169a6982f44be5629a8f5ed8af,3/23/17,1
lossyrob,"So this is an issue with http reading w/ signed urls, not with the s3 stream reading, correct?",3/23/17,1
kthompson,yea i havent tried using the normal S3 way,3/23/17,1
kthompson,"i did try doing ""streaming"" from a local file though and that seemed to work",3/23/17,1
lossyrob,"@kthompson gridbounds needs an integer size, so codified that. Like rasterextent, which is a grid extent, perhaps there should be a less restrictive bounds",3/23/17,1
kthompson,yea we are working with some really big geotiff(whole US)  and trying to stream it but I think for now we will just tile it with gdal first,3/23/17,1
lossyrob,Ok that's good to know - is the http reader in the gist a fix?,3/23/17,1
lossyrob,"If it's possible to stream, the http should do it correctly ",3/23/17,1
kthompson,the httpreader in the gist is a workaround as S3 doesnt seems to allow HEAD requests on signed urls,3/23/17,1
lossyrob,So id want to fix for 1.1,3/23/17,1
lossyrob,Does s3 just return the whole tile in that case?,3/23/17,1
kthompson,it seems a bit lame of S3 to allow a GET but not a HEAD request,3/23/17,1
kthompson,no it does support the range request and it is returning chunks,3/23/17,1
kthompson,the cropped tile looks vaguely similar so its working to some degree,3/23/17,1
lossyrob,"Ok, gotcha. So we need to support byte range reading on http that doesn't support the HEAD request technique that we currently use, and uses GET instead",3/23/17,1
lossyrob,Can you write an issue for that pointing to your gist? That should go into RC2,3/23/17,1
kthompson,sure but also the cropped part of that tiff is all wrong,3/23/17,1
kthompson,should i specify that in the same issue as well?,3/23/17,1
lossyrob,Yeah. Probably there's some fixes to that code that's required,3/23/17,1
kthompson,:+1: ,3/23/17,1
lossyrob,If you want to keep going on it the effort is appreciated ,3/23/17,1
kthompson,yea i dont know that i could get up to speed on the geotiff bits as well as you guys :),3/23/17,1
lossyrob,"True, it's a pretty complicated setup, but the more people that know the better :)",3/23/17,1
kthompson,haha yea :smile: ,3/23/17,1
kthompson,"does this seem odd or incorrect `originalExtent.buffer(-Math.min(originalExtent.height, originalExtent.width) / 4)`",3/23/17,1
kthompson,im basically trying to shrink the extent by some amount,3/23/17,1
lossyrob,Doesn't seem odd to me ,3/23/17,1
kthompson,ok thanks :thumbsup: ,3/23/17,1
kthompson,so just to be a bit more thourough it also looks like when i use the `S3RangeReader` i get a similar output that is incorrect as well,3/23/17,1
lossyrob,That's not good,3/23/17,1
kthompson,yea :/,3/23/17,1
lossyrob,that_„Žs with that same `small.tif?`,3/23/17,1
kthompson,"yea basically nearly identical as the gist i posted except with `val streamer = S3RangeReader(""https://kevin-test-bucket1.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/input.tif"", S3Client.DEFAULT)` and the small.tif isnt looking correct",3/23/17,1

lossyrob,this is what the tiff looks like to me in qgis just from grabbing it from s3,3/23/17,1
lossyrob,w/ `wget`,3/23/17,1
lossyrob,that doesn_„Žt look right_„_how was this written?,3/23/17,1
kthompson,that was created by the code in the gist,3/23/17,1
lossyrob,"oh so that_„Žs the result, not the input",3/23/17,1
lossyrob,gotcha,3/23/17,1
kthompson,correct,3/23/17,1
lossyrob,I_„Žm getting a 403 forbidden for the wget on the url (with sig) from the gist,3/23/17,1
lossyrob,"oh wait I_„m pasting wrong, one sec",3/23/17,1
kthompson,:thumbsup: ,3/23/17,1
lossyrob,"and you said you can read windows fine with that file and crop, when it_„Žs on the filesystem?",3/23/17,1
kthompson,yes,3/23/17,1
kthompson,the source tiff is compressed to so that probably plays into it somehow,3/23/17,1
lossyrob,it shouldn_„Žt at all,3/23/17,1
lossyrob,compression happens at the geotiff segment level,3/23/17,1
lossyrob,inner-segment,3/23/17,1
kthompson,oh ok,3/23/17,1
lossyrob,the cropping stuff happens in terms of segments,3/23/17,1
kthompson,so `GeoTiffReader.readMultiband` has a `decompress` parameter is that something unrelated to the geotiff compression?,3/23/17,1
lossyrob,it does decompress,3/23/17,1
kthompson,"ie its ""decompressing"" immediately rather than lazily",3/23/17,1
lossyrob,"but the mechanisms that do the streaming, and the mechanisms that do decompression, are orthogonal ",3/23/17,1
lossyrob,yeah it decompresses the whole segment once it has it,3/23/17,1
lossyrob,it_„Žs the fetching of the segments and determining what those segments mean as far as contributing pixels) is what seems to be mucking up,3/23/17,1
kthompson,yea,3/23/17,1
lossyrob,"ok, I have the image. looking into it now",3/23/17,1
lossyrob,"@kthompson can you try with `    val tiff = MultibandGeoTiff.streaming(reader, false, true)` ?",3/23/17,1
lossyrob,wait nvm,3/23/17,1
lossyrob,I misread the code,3/23/17,1
kthompson,yea i think `MultibandGeoTiff.streaming` already calls it that way,3/23/17,1
kthompson,or calls `GeoTiffReader.readMultiband` rather,3/23/17,1
lossyrob,hmm I_„Žm getting the same looking error from the file crop,3/23/17,1
lossyrob,just from disk,3/23/17,1
lossyrob,"which is good, easier to debug",3/23/17,1
kthompson,haha well that sgood i suppose,3/23/17,1
kthompson,"ok so if i do `GeoTiffReader.readMultiband(""input.tif"", true, true)` locally it works",3/23/17,1
lossyrob,decompress I think doesn_„Žt work with the streaming option,3/23/17,1
lossyrob,or with the cropping. I might be wrong,3/23/17,1
kthompson,"`GeoTiffReader.readMultiband(""input.tif"", false, true)` give the weird output",3/23/17,1
lossyrob,"if you say decompress, it won_„Žt lazy crop",3/23/17,1
lossyrob,that_„Žs actually an API problem,3/23/17,1
kthompson,ok yea thats what it seemed like earlier when i was testing that,3/23/17,1
lossyrob,looksl like we missed testing pixel interleave multiband geotiffs. looking for the fix now,3/23/17,1
kthompson,awesome,3/23/17,1
Charmatzis,"Hi, is there a project or example where you have used the Terrain Tiles on AWS  ? (https://aws.amazon.com/public-datasets/terrain/ )",3/24/17,1
karalas,"hi all, I want to ingest many tiffs in cassandra of about 500MB each. I have placed my tiffs under the same folder which i give as input to ```path``` in ```input.json```.  I can ingest max 2 such tiffs, from 3 and above i get an ```ERROR Executor: Exception in task 2.0 in stage 1.0 (TID 5)java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space```. I am running spark in a single machine and calling ```spark-submit``` with ```--driver-memory 7G --executor-memory 8G``` parameters. ",3/24/17,1
karalas,"so the process in etl tries to ingest all the images in memory at once and that's why my memory explodes? what can i do, ingest one by one?",3/24/17,1

Charmatzis,these are for the java,3/24/17,1
Charmatzis,think of it like when you executing sbt the default params are,3/24/17,1
Charmatzis,https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/blob/master/sbt#L24 ,3/24/17,1
karalas,"@Charmatzis  thank you, that indeed worked with 3 images, but when i tried with 15 images for example, i got the same error.  I set ```javaOptions += ""-XX:MaxPermSize=512M -d64 -Xms512m -Xmx8g""``` in ```build.sbt``` of both root and ingest folder.",3/24/17,1
Charmatzis, @karalas  I believe you should inject that in the spar-submit as an option,3/24/17,1
Charmatzis,like java-opts,3/24/17,1
pomadchin,@karalas yo! how many nods do you have?,3/24/17,1
pomadchin,how do you submit your job? (params),3/24/17,1
Charmatzis,@karalas  like that ,3/24/17,1
Charmatzis,http://stackoverflow.com/a/21157374 ,3/24/17,1
pomadchin,it can be done in a bit more human usable way :D,3/24/17,1
pomadchin,like this: https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis-landsat-emr-demo/blob/master/Makefile#L91-L98,3/24/17,1
pomadchin,"during the `spark-submit` launch you can specify memory, cores, etc, per each executor and for driver",3/24/17,1
pomadchin,so there are several options: in the `output.json` you can add a `_„ñpartitions_„:_„5000_„` parameter to make calculations more spark usable (sure if you have more than one node),3/24/17,1
pomadchin,the partitions you have the easier it should work,3/24/17,1
pomadchin,spark would be less restricted in memory shuffle,3/24/17,1
pomadchin,and there is a chance that it would resolve the task even on low memory nodes,3/24/17,1

kthompson,"does this seem right? ```   def fillRaster(raster: Raster[Tile], newExtent: Extent): Option[Raster[Tile]] = {    if (newExtent.contains(raster.extent)) {      Some {        val re      = RasterExtent(newExtent, CellSize(256, 256))        val newTile = DoubleArrayTile.ofDim(re.cols, re.rows)        val colOffset = re.mapXToGrid(raster.extent.xmin)        val rowOffset = re.mapXToGrid(raster.extent.ymin)        newTile.update(colOffset, rowOffset, raster)        Raster(newTile, newExtent)      }    } else {      None    }  }```",3/28/17,1
kthompson,looks like i have a typo with thw rowOffset using mapX instead of mapY,3/28/17,1
pomadchin,"@kthompson are you talking about the following?1. ingest a tile / set of tiles into layer2. add more tiles that would be out of already ingested data ",3/28/17,1
lossyrob,you could use `merge`,3/28/17,1

kthompson,yea ok,3/28/17,1
lossyrob,it_„Žs how we do pyramiding and the like,3/28/17,1
kthompson,oh nice that works with multiband tiles too,3/28/17,1
kthompson,"is there a way to generate an empty multiband tiles with the correct number of bands similar to `DoubleArrayTile.ofDim(re.cols, re.rows)`",3/28/17,1

kthompson,"```MultibandTile(          (0 to raster.tile.bandCount)            .map(_ => DoubleArrayTile.ofDim(re.cols, re.rows)))```should work",3/28/17,1
lossyrob,yeah. that_„Žs a bit of missing API I_„Žd say,3/28/17,1
kthompson,"so i got ```  private def fillRaster(raster: Raster[MultibandTile], newExtent: Extent): Option[Raster[MultibandTile]] = {    if (newExtent.contains(raster.extent)) {      val RasterExtent(_, cellWidth, cellHeight, _, _) = raster.rasterExtent      Some {        val re = RasterExtent(newExtent, CellSize(cellWidth, cellHeight))        val newTile = MultibandTile(          (0 to raster.tile.bandCount)            .map(_ => DoubleArrayTile.ofDim(re.cols, re.rows)))        Raster(newTile, newExtent).merge(raster)      }    } else {      None    }  }```",3/28/17,1

kthompson,so im trying out my test https://gist.github.com/kthompson/7462b7169a6982f44be5629a8f5ed8af and it seems like the extent i specify im downloading about 33mb but even if i make it smaller by buffering it more it still downloads 33mb. and the `crop` method does appear to be returning.,3/28/17,1
kthompson,ignore the NOTES bit,3/28/17,1
kthompson,i am trying with just a local file now to see if there is any difference,3/28/17,1
kthompson,the output shows looking how youd expect but it does not appear to be cropped,3/28/17,1
kthompson,ie the image isnt pixelated or anything but its the same size as the original,3/28/17,1
kthompson,"Here is my log output:```Original extent: Extent(691500.0, 4151500.0, 716500.0, 4176500.0)New extent: Extent(691500.09765625, 4151500.09765625, 716499.90234375, 4176499.90234375)cropping tiff DEBUG[main] UInt16GeoTiffMultibandTile - Cropping GridBounds(0,0,4999,4999) uses 5000 out of 5000 pixel-interleave segments```",3/28/17,1
kthompson,ugh my cropped extent is dumb,3/28/17,1
kthompson,ok so ignore everything I said streaming with interleaved tiles is looking good :thumbsup:  its downloading about half the size of the original geotiff when i request an extent that is about half the size. so nice work,3/28/17,1
Charmatzis,"@lossyrob Well I have search for JTS and how it handles the dayline issues and I didn't found a solution, even though I have develped a solution for vectors but now I am dealing with rasters. Maybe I should find my own solution. ",3/29/17,1
karalas,"hi, I try to use layer updater with cassandra in order to ingest a lot of tiffs of the same area but with different dates. The code I am trying is here https://github.com/karalas/geotrellis-sentinel-demo/blob/master/ingest/src/main/scala/demo/SentinelIngestMain.scala, but I can see the my mem (~10g) bumps up again and goes to swap. Then I get a ```com.datastax.driver.core.exceptions.OperationTimedOutException: [localhost/127.0.0.1:9042] Timed out waiting for server response```.  Obviously I am doing smth wrong..",3/29/17,1
pomadchin,"@karalas so the idea of a snippet i throwed you in a following: let it be 10 tiles to ingest:1.  ingest a first tile using layerWriter (and with [fixed](https://github.com/karalas/geotrellis-sentinel-demo/blob/master/ingest/src/main/scala/demo/SentinelIngestMain.scala#L153-L158) temporal keybounds for the ingested layer)2. ingest other tiles with layerUpdater one by one (in separate jobs)",3/29/17,1
pomadchin,"how layer updater works: grabs layer you want to ignest keybounds, makes a db lookup layer (if there would be some intersections, in your case - no intersections), merges if there are some intersections, writes",3/29/17,1
pomadchin,how do you work with it?,3/29/17,1
karalas,@pomadchin I think that until https://github.com/karalas/geotrellis-sentinel-demo/blob/master/ingest/src/main/scala/demo/SentinelIngestMain.scala#L161 is my initial ingest and then with https://github.com/karalas/geotrellis-sentinel-demo/blob/master/ingest/src/main/scala/demo/SentinelIngestMain.scala#L178-L186 I try to ingest the second image in order to update the layer. Is this what you asked me for? Maybe you mean that here https://github.com/karalas/geotrellis-sentinel-demo/blob/master/ingest/src/main/scala/demo/SentinelIngestMain.scala#L178 I need to call a ```new SparkContext```?,3/29/17,1
lossyrob,@Charmatzis `spatial4j` (another locationtech project) handles this,3/29/17,1
lossyrob,"it_„Žs a library that is by a solar/lucene committer, who works on thier spatial stuff",3/29/17,1
pomadchin,"@karalas that_„Žs correct; just split that into two separate jobs; one for update, second one for ingest",3/29/17,1
pomadchin,and launch two different spark-submit jobs,3/29/17,1
pomadchin,hey @karalas do you need some additional clarification?,3/29/17,1
kthompson,is SpatialKey in grid coordinates? ,3/29/17,1
pomadchin,"eh, yes; if you meant by grid your layout: https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Tile_Map_Service_Specification",3/29/17,1
kthompson,yea trying to learn all of the lingo to understand a bit better,3/29/17,1
pomadchin,no problem at all :D ,3/29/17,1
kthompson,well like RasterExtent is to convert map coordinates to grid coordinates,3/29/17,1
kthompson,"are those ""grid"" coordinates the same concept as SpatialKey?",3/29/17,1
pomadchin,"ah, in context of raster extent: toGrid => converts your spatial coords into a certain tile grid coords (col, row); fromGrid convert grid coords to spatial coordsspatial coords in this context are real world coordinates, like some coords in lat lng, web mercator, etc",3/29/17,1
kthompson,yea i think i understand those bits and that all pertains to a Tile in geotrellis,3/29/17,1
kthompson,and I know that SpatialKey indicates the position of a Tile within a layer,3/29/17,1
kthompson,"but im not sure what col/row actually mean in a SpatialKey or like what ""unit"" they are in",3/29/17,1
pomadchin,integers;,3/29/17,1
pomadchin,https://wiki.osgeo.org/images/e/e7/Tms.png,3/29/17,1
kthompson,but they are not literally the tile col/row within a layer right? they correspond to some higher level maybe the whole world?,3/29/17,1
pomadchin,"probably i'm just a bit misunderstanding a problem O: they are a col / row in terms of layer but there are laws; it_„Žs a quad tree, so on zoom level 0 you have only 1 tile, on zoom leve 2 you would have 4 tiles, _„_, etc",3/29/17,1
pomadchin,"and these keys always correspond tile extent; you always have `SpatialKey <=> Extent` functions o:",3/29/17,1
pomadchin,"a good example of a spatial key is any leaflet map, or google earth; you can notice these squares on a map when you zoom in / zoom out; these tiles correspond directly to geotrellis SpatialKey (we are talking about zoomed layout scheme in gt)",3/29/17,1

lossyrob,should that be a lib method?,3/29/17,1
pomadchin,sounds like a useful method O:,3/29/17,1
lossyrob,"@ASellers not quite out-of-the-box. But it is possible - do you mean _„ñI have a set of Shapefiles on HDFS or S3, and I want to pull out feature data from them into an RDD of feature data_„?",3/29/17,1
ASellers,"Hi, @lossyrob - thanks for the help.  That's right.  I have a collection of ShapeFiles that we want to be able to parse at scale to leverage spatial context in a predictive analytics application that requires us to join them with other data sets that contain (for example) point in space information, and answer geo-queries efficiently.",3/29/17,1
ASellers,Appreciate any insight about a possible approach.,3/29/17,1
lossyrob,"We have an `InputFormat` that can read binary data from Hadoop or S3. It would require writing a custom subclass of that, to produce the required geometries. We have a wrapper over GeoTools that allows reading shapefiles - unfortuantely last time I looked I couldn_„Žt figure out how to get it to read a shapefile from an `Array[Byte]` (which you would have from reading via the InputFormat), so that would have to be figured out. Once you are there, it_„Žs pretty simple to use that InputFormat to create a spark RDD of the things that InputFormat produces: in this case it can be our feature datatype, `Feature[Geometry, Map[String,Object]]`, so in the end you have an `RDD[Feature[Geometry, Map[String,Object]]]`. After that, you can start to work with the geometry data e.g. use our [VectorJoin](https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/join/VectorJoin.scala#L30) to do efficient joins of the data (requiring spatial partitioning beforehand), or using [SpatialJoin](https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/geotrellis/spark/join/SpatialJoin.scala#L27) to gather geometries that have the same tile key on a grid layout. The join part is totally do-able, but because we_„Žve focused a lot on raster data there will certainly be bumps in the road using that API",3/29/17,1
kthompson,@pomadchin yea basically just get the area of the tile that has cells with data(as opposed to NoData),3/29/17,1
kthompson,ill do the iteration bits but i think it would be useful for like when you want to crop an image to its data like for thumbnails for instance,3/29/17,1
ASellers,@lossyrob - that's helpful.  Thank you very much.,3/29/17,1
lossyrob,"makes sense. If you threw that into a `Methods` trait on Tile/MultibandTile so that it is implicitly added to the core types, that would make a good PR",3/29/17,1

echeipesh,Is it a pattern that you_„Žve used in your app and seen a benefit ?,3/30/17,1

kthompson,is there a from of BitArrayTile where the zeros are treated as noData?,3/30/17,1
echeipesh,"No, we made a call that that didn_„Žt seem to make sense as a data type (https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/blob/master/raster/src/main/scala/geotrellis/raster/CellType.scala#L343) because there would only be one possible data value. Is it causing ugly code ?",3/30/17,1
kthompson,well for example if you call toVector on a Raster that has a BitArrayTile you end up with a Polygon the size of the extent,3/30/17,1
kthompson,even if all the values are zero,3/30/17,1
kthompson,which if its a bitmask im expecting an empty polygon,3/30/17,1
echeipesh,"hmm, thats opposite of good.",3/30/17,1
kthompson,haha,3/30/17,1
kthompson,so i guess im going to need to do some custom cases where if cellType==BitCellType && value == 0 then do the thing,3/30/17,1
echeipesh,"That_„Žs an embarassing problem, I_„Žm having hard time coming up with a graceful work-around. Probably if there was a class that wrapped `Tile` interface and map `0 => NODATA` is probably the easiest patch that doesn_„Žt envolve cell widening on the tile.",3/30/17,1
kthompson,yea i am guessing creating a new CellType would probably not be trivial either,3/30/17,1
echeipesh,"well that_„Žs not really a problem, but hooking it into `BitArrayTile` won_„Žt happen since its hard coded.",3/30/17,1

kthompson,i dont actually need to vectorize the raster but i was using it to verify how my raster actually looked,3/30/17,1

kthompson,:thumbsup: ,3/30/17,1
kthompson,yea i wonder how BitArrayTile is commonly used,3/30/17,1
kthompson,our use case is basically to mask pixels on other tiles so we need it just to say whether or not we want to save pixels in another tile,3/30/17,1
echeipesh,Hard for me to say what _„ñcommon_„ means :) Usually if it_„Žs used in `combine` matching on 1/0 is fine.,3/30/17,1
kthompson,yea i hear you :),3/30/17,1
echeipesh,But bit rasters pretty much always end up being a special case. Reading them from GeoTiff is strange as well.,3/30/17,1

aaron-santos,"hey, I'm working on some optimizations and I'm looking for some validation to see if they pass the smell test or if there might be better ways to accomplish the same thing",4/5/17,1
aaron-santos,"the first is that some of the satellite imagery I'm ingesting has bands at different resolutions. I'm thinking about ingesting the highest resolution bands first and  as the zoom level matches the native resolution of the low-res bands, modifying the rdd being ingested to include the new bands",4/5/17,1
aaron-santos,"this might mean that a multibandtile at zoom=16 might have 5 bands, while a multibandtile at zoom=12 might have 10 bands and one at zoom=10 might have 13 bands. The application would necessarily have to sort this out during tile retrieval",4/5/17,1
aaron-santos,The other idea (and not necessarily mutually exclusive) is writing an avrocodec for multiband tiles that stores band offsets as part of a header and turning off avro compression. But it would mean that I could read these offsets and then perform range requests (to S3) in this case to just get bands that I care about. I'll need to select different bands for different use cases,4/5/17,1
echeipesh,"@aaron-santos seems like those two options are optimizing for different things, what is the thing you most care about or are you just trying to sort out _„ñgenerally good_„ way to store and query multi-resolution multi-band data ?",4/5/17,1
aaron-santos,"yes, one for reducing storage size, and the other for reducing transfer cost",4/5/17,1
aaron-santos,I'm trying to improve on the system I have now that downsamples low-res bands to match the hi-res bands and retrieves all the bands even if I just need one or two. Optimizing two different things for sure,4/5/17,1
echeipesh,"Its definatly a problem that needs to be solved in the API, currently we completely punted on it. Doing a sub-set band reads is always awesome. The first option seems like you would get for free by just storing two layers (that would mess with your appilication logic though). Hmm..",4/5/17,1
aaron-santos,I'm willing to add quite a bit of complexity too.  :),4/5/17,1
echeipesh,From the application standpoint would it be better to store tiny tiles for low rez images with only pixels that overlap the area or store full sized tiles at higher zoom levels ?,4/5/17,1
aaron-santos,Can you explain that a little more?,4/5/17,1
echeipesh,"Well, potentially there can be a tile type that holds different resolution images. In order for it to be true to extent bounds it would need to have less pixels per low-res band vs high-res band for the same zoom level. Just wondering if from standpoint of your application that is even a useful behavior or if going up the zoom levels to fetch first _„ñ256x256_„ tile for low-res band is actually the prefered way of handling it.",4/5/17,1
aaron-santos,"that's an interesting idea! I was thinking I'd have to pull from different zooms if I wanted to ""overzoom"" a band which was not available for the zoom level I was interested in",4/5/17,1

lossyrob,"the idea is that we would have web mercator tiles who_„Žs internal tiling was 256x256, which match the TMS tiles we currently store all as separate files",4/5/17,1
lossyrob,"but because of byte range requests, we can get away with only pulling the data we need",4/5/17,1
lossyrob,"but in case we need a lot of data, we only have to make a small number of GET requests, whereas now we have to make a lot",4/5/17,1

kthompson,i ended up using `ZoomedLayoutScheme.layoutColsForZoom` and `layoutRowsForZoom` which is basically the same as in your example but it felt nicer to me :),4/6/17,1
kthompson,"ie `math.pow(2, level)`",4/6/17,1
pomadchin,"haha, sure, your solution is better :D ",4/6/17,1
